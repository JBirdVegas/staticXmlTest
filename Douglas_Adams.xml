At the moment we can't afford to go to other planets. We don't have the ships to take us there.

In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!" This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. "I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for." We all know that at some point in the future the Universe will come to an end and at some other point, considerably in advance from that but still not immediately pressing, the sun will explode. We feel there's plenty of time to worry about that, but on the other hand that's a very dangerous thing to say.</quote><quote id="6" author="Douglas Adams" cats="2000s deaths|Absurdists|Atheists|Comedic authors|English novelists|English people|Fantasy authors|Satirists|Science fiction authors" ref="">"There are some oddities in the perspective with which we see the world." The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be, but we have done various things over intellectual history to slowly correct some of our misapprehensions.</quote><quote id="7" author="Douglas Adams" cats="2000s deaths|Absurdists|Atheists|Comedic authors|English novelists|English people|Fantasy authors|Satirists|Science fiction authors" ref="">"A learning experience is one of those things that say, "You know that thing you just did?

Life is a level of complexity that almost lies outside our vision; it is so far beyond anything we have any means of understanding that we just think of it as a different class of object, a different class of matter; 'life', something that had a mysterious essence about it, was God given, and that's the only explanation we had. The bombshell comes in 1859 when Darwin publishes "On the Origin of Species". It takes a long time before we really get to grips with this and begin to understand it, because not only does it seem incredible and thoroughly demeaning to us, but it's yet another shock to our system to discover that not only are we not the centre of the Universe and we're not made by anything, but "we started out as some kind of slime and got to where we are via being a monkey. It just doesn't read well."</quote><quote id="10" author="Douglas Adams" cats="2000s deaths|Absurdists|Atheists|Comedic authors|English novelists|English people|Fantasy authors|Satirists|Science fiction authors" ref="">"The world is a thing of utter inordinate complexity and richness and strangeness that is absolutely awesome." I mean the idea that such complexity can arise not only out of such simplicity, but probably absolutely out of nothing, is the most fabulous extraordinary idea. And once you get some kind of inkling of how that might have happened, it's just wonderful. And … the opportunity to spend 70 or 80 years of your life in such a universe is time well spent as far as I am concerned.</quote><quote id="11" author="Douglas Adams" cats="2000s deaths|Absurdists|Atheists|Comedic authors|English novelists|English people|Fantasy authors|Satirists|Science fiction authors" ref="">w:aalst|AALST (n.)

This question seemed to provoke a murmur of sympathetic approval from up and down the table. 
Richard continued, "What I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas. And that's really the essence of programming.

"Gravity," said Dirk with a slightly dismissed shrug, "yes, there was that as well, I suppose. Though that, of course, was merely a discovery. It was there to be discovered." ...

Airports are ugly.  Some are very ugly.  Some attain a degree of ugliness that can only be the result of a special effort.

Louis XIV, to pick a name at random, would not have liked it, would have found it not sunny enough, and insufficiently full of mirrors. He would have desired someone to pick up the socks, put the records away, and maybe burn the place down. Michelangelo would have been distressed by its proportions, which were neither lofty nor shaped by any noticeable inner harmony or symmetry, other than that all parts of the room were pretty much equally full of old coffee mugs, shoes and brimming ashtrays, most of which were now sharing their tasks with each other. The walls were painted in almost precisely that shade of green which Raffaello Sanzio would have bitten off his own right hand at the wrist rather than use, and Hercules, on seeing the room, would probably have returned half an hour later armed with a navigable river.

I have therefore learned to turn my attention to other tipples. Margaritas, I'm very fond of, but they make me buy very stupid things. When ever I've had a few margaritas I always wake up in the morning with a sense of dread as to what I will find downstairs.

He was drunk. He was poverty-stricken. He was too poor to afford a room at a youth hostel (the entire story is told at length in his introduction to "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: A Trilogy in Four Parts" in England, and "The Hitchhiker's Trilogy" in the US) and he wound up, at the end of a harrowing day, flat on his back in a field in Innsbruck, staring up at the stars. "Somebody," he thought, "somebody really ought to write a "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"."  
  He forgot about the idea shortly thereafter.
