No wonder no one knows the other or can completely understand. By this I don't know if I'm just giving up with this conclusion or resigning myself - or maybe for the first time connecting with reality. How do we know the pain or another's earlier years, let alone all that he drags with him since along the way at best a lot of leeway is needed for the other - yet how much is unhealthy for one to bear. I think to love bravely is the best and accept - as much as one can bear.</quote><quote id="1" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">For life: It is rather a determination not to be overwhelmed. For work: The truth can only be recalled, never invented.</quote><quote id="2" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"I know I will never be happy but I know I can be gay!"</quote><quote id="3" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"It's not true I had nothing on. I had the radio on."</quote><quote id="4" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">I've been on a calendar, but never on time.</quote><quote id="5" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">I'm a failure as a woman. My men expect so much of me, because of the image they've made of me — and that I've made of myself — as a sex symbol. They expect bells to ring and whistles to whistle, but my anatomy is the same as any other woman's and I can't live up to it.</quote><quote id="6" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">Unfortunately, I am involved in a freedom ride protesting the loss of the minority rights belonging to the few remaining earthbound stars. "All we demanded was our right to twinkle."</quote><quote id="7" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">I think that when you are famous every weakness is exaggerated. ... Goethe said, "Talent is developed in privacy," you know? And it's really true. ... Creativity has got to start with humanity and when you're a human being, you feel, you suffer. You're gay, you're sick, you're nervous or whatever. </quote><quote id="8" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">Say goodbye to Pat, say goodbye to the president, and say goodbye to yourself, because you're a nice guy. ... I'll see, I'll see.</quote><quote id="9" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"Please don't make me a joke. End the interview with what I believe. I don't mind making jokes, but I don't want to look like one... I want to be an artist, an actress with integrity"... If fame goes by, so long, I've had you, fame. If it goes by, I've always known it was fickle. So at least it's something I experienced, but that's not where I live.</quote><quote id="10" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">Say good-bye to Pat, say good-bye to Jack and say good-bye to yourself, because you're a nice guy.</quote><quote id="11" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"An actress is not a machine, but they treat you like a machine. A money machine."</quote><quote id="12" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"Why"? — It paid the rent.</quote><quote id="13" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"I restore myself when I'm alone. A career is born in public — talent in privacy."</quote><quote id="14" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"That's the trouble, a sex symbol becomes a thing. But if I'm going to be a symbol of something, I'd rather it be sex than some of the things we've got symbols of... I just hate to be a thing."</quote><quote id="15" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"I'm not interested in money, I just want to be wonderful."</quote><quote id="16" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">The studio people want me to do "Good-bye Charlie" for the movies, but I'm not going to do it. I don't like the idea of playing a man in a woman's body — you know? It just doesn't seem feminine.</quote><quote id="17" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">First, I'm trying to prove to myself that I'm a person. Then maybe I'll convince myself that I'm an actress.</quote><quote id="18" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"Dogs never bite me. Just humans."</quote><quote id="19" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up.</quote><quote id="20" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">Husbands are chiefly good as lovers when they are betraying their wives.</quote><quote id="21" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">My work is the only ground I've ever had to stand on. I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation — but I'm working on the foundation.</quote><quote id="22" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"Hollywood's a place where they'll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss, and fifty cents for your soul." I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty cents.</quote><quote id="23" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"When you're famous you kind of run into human nature in a raw kind of way. It stirs up envy, fame does." People you run into feel that, well, who does she think she is, Marilyn Monroe? "They feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you, of any kind of nature — and it won't hurt your feelings — like it's happening to your clothes not you."</quote><quote id="24" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"Success makes so many people hate you. I wish it wasn't that way. It would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you."</quote><quote id="25" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">I don't know who invented high heels, but all women owe him a lot.</quote><quote id="26" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"It's far better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone — so far."</quote><quote id="27" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"It stirs up envy, fame does." People you run into feel that, well, who does she think she is, Marilyn Monroe? They feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you, of any kind of nature — and it won't hurt your feelings — like it's happening to your clothes not you.</quote><quote id="28" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"The truth is I've never fooled anyone. I've let people fool themselves. They didn't bother to find out who and what I was." Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn't argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't. When they found this out, they would blame me for disillusioning them and fooling them.</quote><quote id="29" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">A career is wonderful, but you can't curl up with it on a cold night.</quote><quote id="30" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">Arthur Miller wouldn't have married me if I had been nothing but a dumb blonde. </quote><quote id="31" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn't see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one."</quote><quote id="32" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">I think Marilyn is bound to make an almost overwhelming impression on the people who meet her for the first time. It is not that she is pretty, although she is of course almost incredibly pretty, but she radiates, at the same time, unbounded vitality and a kind of unbelievable innocence. I have met the same in a lion-cub, which my native servants in Africa brought me. I would not keep her, since I felt that it would in some way be wrong..."I shall never forget the almost overpowering feeling of unconquerable strength and sweetness which she conveyed. I had all the wild nature of Africa amicably gazing at me with mighty playfulness."</quote><quote id="33" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">When Marilyn Monroe got out of the game, I wrote something like, "Southern California's special horror notwithstanding, "if the world offered nothing, nowhere to support or make bearable whatever her private grief was, then it is that world, and not she, that is at fault.""
I wrote that in the first few shook-up minutes after hearing the bulletin sandwiched in between Don and Phil Everly and surrounded by all manner of whoops and whistles coming out of an audio signal generator, like you are apt to hear on the provincial radio these days. But I don't think I'd take those words back.</quote><quote id="34" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">"If Marilyn is in love with my husband it proves she has good taste, for I am in love with him too."</quote><quote id="35" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">I remember her on the screen, huge as a colossus doll, mincing and whispering and simply hoping her way into total vulnerability.</quote><quote id="36" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">[http://www.russianpaintings.net/doc.vphp?id=770 Andy Warhol's Marilyn Pictures] </quote><quote id="37" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">{{imdb name|id=0000054|name=Marilyn Monroe}}</quote><quote id="38" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">[http://www.time.com/time/time100/heroes/profile/monroe01.html TIME 100: Marilyn Monroe]</quote><quote id="39" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">[http://youtube.com/watch?v=nO3-ZdkO6Fk  Archival newsreels of Monroe]</quote><quote id="40" author="Marilyn Monroe" cats="1960s deaths|American actors|Models|Singers" ref="">[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/cl-marilynstories-death,0,237194.gallery?coll=la-home-headlines Coverage of Monroe's death and aftermath] by the "Los Angeles Times"</quote></quotes>
