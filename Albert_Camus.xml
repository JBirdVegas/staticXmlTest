But for this lesson to get through and convince those in the West who shut their eyes and ears, it was necessary, and it can be no comfort to us, for the people of Hungary to shed so much blood which is already drying in our memories. In Europe's isolation today, we have only one way of being true to Hungary, and that is never to betray, among ourselves and everywhere, what the Hungarian heroes died for, never to condone, among ourselves and everywhere, even indirectly, those who killed them. It would indeed be difficult for us to be worthy of such sacrifices.</quote><quote id="8" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"A character is never the author who created him.

Still, to my mind, he overdid it, and I'd have liked to have a chance of explaining to him, in a quite friendly, almost affectionate way, that I have never been able to really regret anything in all my life. I've always been far too much absorbed in the present moment, or the immediate future, to think back.</quote><quote id="24" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">The papers were always talking about the debt owed to society. According to them, it had to be paid. But that doesn't speak to the imagination. What really counted was the possibility of escape, a leap to freedom, out of the implacable ritual, a wild run for it that would give whatever chance for hope there was. Of course, hope meant being cut down on some street corner, as you ran like mad, by a random bullet. But when I really thought it through, nothing was going to allow me such a luxury. Everything was against it; I would just be caught up in the machinery again.</quote><quote id="25" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"I may not have been sure about what really did interest me, but I was absolutely sure about what didn't."</quote><quote id="26" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"I had only a little time left and I didn't want to waste it on God."</quote><quote id="27" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">Maman used to say that you can always find something to be happy about.</quote><quote id="28" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">I don't know why, but something inside me snapped. I started yelling at the top of my lungs, and I insulted him and told him not to waste his prayers on me. I grabbed him by the collar of his cassock. I was pouring out on him everything that was in my heart, cries of anger and cries of joy. 
He seemed so certain about everything, didn't he? And yet none of his certainties was worth one hair of a woman's head. He wasn't even sure he was alive, because he was living like a dead man. Whereas it looked as if I was the one who'd come up emptyhanded. But I was sure about me, about everything, surer than he could ever be, sure of my life and sure of the death I had waiting for me. Yes, that was all I had. But at least I had as much of a hold on it as it had on me. I had been right, I was still right, I was always right. I had lived my life one way and I could just as well have lived it another. I had done this and I hadn't done that. I hadn't done this thing but I had done another. And so? "It was as if I had waited all this time for this moment and for the first light of this dawn to be vindicated." Nothing, nothing mattered, and I knew why. So did he. "Throughout the whole absurd life I'd lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from somewhere deep in my future, across years that were still to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever was offered to me at the time, in years no more real than the ones I was living." What did other people's deaths or a mother's love matter to me; what did his God or the lives people choose or the fate they think they elect matter to me when we're all elected by the same fate, me and billions of privileged people like him who also called themselves my brothers? Couldn't he see, couldn't he see that? "Everybody was privileged. There were only privileged people." The others would all be condemned one day. And he would be condemned, too. translated by Matthew Ward</quote><quote id="29" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">For the first time in a long time I thought about Maman. I felt as if I understood why at the end of  her life she had taken a 'fiancé,' why she had played at beginning again. Even there, in that home  where lives were fading out, evening was a kind of wistful respite. So close to death, Maman must  have felt free then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over her.  And I felt ready to live it all again too. "As if the blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope;  for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference  of the world." Finding it so much like myself — so like a brother, really — I felt I had been happy and  that I was happy again. For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to  wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with  cries of hate.</quote><quote id="30" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"Nothing is harder to understand than a symbolic work.

A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. "This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity." 153</quote><quote id="33" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">Like great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are conscious of saying.</quote><quote id="34" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">Great novelists are philosopher-novelists who write in images instead of arguments.</quote><quote id="35" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"Great feelings take with them their own universe, splendid or abject." They light up with their passion an exclusive world in which they recognize their climate. There is a universe of jealousy, of ambition, of selfishness or generosity.

Rising, streetcar, four hours in the office or the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, sleep and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday according to the same rhythm — this path is easily followed most of the time.

And these two certainties — my appetite for the absolute and for unity and the impossibility of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle — I also know that I cannot reconcile them.

He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world." This must not be forgotten. This must be clung to because the whole consequence of a life can depend on it. The irrational, the human nostalgia, and the absurd that is born of their encounter — these are the three characters in the drama that must necessarily end with all the logic of which an existence is capable.</quote><quote id="49" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">""My field," said Goethe, "is time." That is indeed the absurd speech." What, in fact, is the Absurd Man? He who, without negating it, does nothing for the eternal. Not that nostalgia is foreign to him. But he prefers his courage and his reasoning. The first teaches him to live without appeal and to get along with what he has; the second informs him of his limits. Assured of his temporally limited freedom, of his revolt devoid of future, and of his mortal consciousness, he lives out his adventure within the span of his lifetime.</quote><quote id="50" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"There can be no question of holding forth on ethics. I have seen people behave badly with great morality and I note every day that integrity has no need of rules." There is but one moral code that the absurd man can accept, the one that is not separated from God: the one that is dictated. But it so happens that he lives outside that God. As for the others (I mean also immoralism), the absurd man sees nothing in them but justifications and he has nothing to justify. "I start out here from the principle of his innocence.
That innocence is to be feared." "Everything is permitted," exclaims Ivan Karamazov. That, too, smacks of the absurd. But on condition that it not be taken in a vulgar sense. "I don't know whether or not it has been sufficiently pointed out that it is not an outburst of relief or of joy, but rather a bitter acknowledgment of a fact."</quote><quote id="51" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"The absurd does not liberate; it binds. It does not authorize all actions. "Everything is permitted" does not mean that nothing is forbidden."</quote><quote id="52" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"All systems of morality are based on the idea that an action has consequences that legitimize or cancel it. A mind imbued with the absurd merely judges that those consequences must be considered calmly." It is ready to pay up. In other words, there may be responsible persons, but there are no guilty ones, in its opinion. At very most, such a mind will consent to use past experience as a basis for its future actions.</quote><quote id="53" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"Time will prolong time, and life will serve life." In this field that is both limited and bulging with possibilities, everything to himself, except his lucidity, seems unforeseeable to him. What rule, then, could emanate from that unreasonable order? "The only truth that might seem instructive to him is not formal: it comes to life and unfolds in men. The absurd mind cannot so much expect ethical rules at the end of its reasoning as, rather, illustrations and the breath of human lives."</quote><quote id="54" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">A sub-clerk in the post office is the equal of a conqueror if consciousness is common to them. All experiences are indifferent in this regard. There are some that do either a service or a disservice to man. They do him a service if he is conscious. Otherwise, that has no importance:" a man's failures imply judgment, not of circumstances, but of himself."</quote><quote id="55" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"If the world were clear, art would not exist."</quote><quote id="56" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"One recognizes one's course by discovering the paths that stray from it."</quote><quote id="57" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">To work and create "for nothing," to sculpture in clay, to know one's creation has no future, to see one's work destroyed in a day while being aware that fundamentally this has no more importance than building for centuries — this is the difficult wisdom that absurd thought sanctions. Performing these two tasks simultaneously, negating on the one hand and magnifying on the other, it the way open to the absurd creator. He must give the void its colors. </quote><quote id="58" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"A profound thought is in a constant state of becoming; it adopts the experience of a life and assumes its shape." Likewise, a man's sole creation is strengthened in its successive and multiple aspects: his works. One after another they complement one another, correct or overtake one another, contradict one another, too. If something brings creation to an end, it is not the victorious and illusory cry of the blinded artist: "I have said everything," but the death of the creator which closes his experiences and the book of his genius.
That effort, that superhuman consciousness are not necessarily apparent to the reader. There is no mystery in human creation. Will performs this miracle. But at least there is no true creation without a secret. "To be true, a succession of works can be but a series of approximations of the same thought." But it is possible to conceive of another type of creator proceeding by juxtaposition. Their words may seem to be devoid of inter-relations, to a certain degree, they are contradictory. But viewed all together, they resume their natural groupings.</quote><quote id="59" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"Of all the schools of patience and lucidity, creation is the most effective." It is also the staggering evidence of man's sole dignity: the dogged revolt against his condition, perseverance in an effort considered sterile. It calls for a daily effort, self-mastery, a precise estimate of the limits of truth, measure, and strength. It constitutes an ascesis. All that "for nothing," in order to repeat and mark time. But perhaps the great work of art has less importance in itself than in the ordeal it demands of a man and the opportunity it provides him of overcoming his phantoms and approaching a little closer to his naked reality.</quote><quote id="60" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"Ironic philosophies produce passionate works." 
Any thought that abandons unity glorifies diversity! And diversity is the home of art. The only thought to liberate the mind is that which leaves it alone, certain of its limits and of its impending end. "No doctrine tempts it. It awaits the ripening of the work and of life."  116</quote><quote id="61" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"In that daily effort in which intelligence and passion mingle and delight each other, the absurd man discovers a discipline that will make up the greatest of his strengths." The required diligence and doggedness and lucidity thus resemble the conqueror's attitude. To create is likewise to give a shape to one's fate. For all these characters, their work defines them at least as much as it is defined by them. The actor taught us this: There is no frontier between being and appearing.</quote><quote id="62" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">"Outside of that single fatality of death, everything, joy or happiness, is liberty."</quote><quote id="63" author="Albert Camus" cats="1960s deaths|Absurdists|Authors|Nobel Prize winners|Philosophers" ref="">The world evades us because it becomes itself again.
