I believed from the beginning that [the lawsuit] was an attempt to muzzle my voice, and I come from a people who have struggled and died in order to have a voice in this country.

That's why when I was on the show and said "I've lived this way my whole life", and people who watched our show for years know that I've been talking about how you take responsibility for your life and the choices that you make. Empower your life. And so, when I say that, you know, um, that's how I live my life, the message of "The Secret", that's what I mean. I "also" believe, that, uh, medical healing or healing comes in lots of forms. You know that adage about the guy being lost and God sent him a boat and God sent him— then he gets to heaven and says "Why didn't you help me?" And God's, "I sent you the boat, fool!" So, that's the way I look at medical healing.</quote><quote id="5" author="Oprah Winfrey" cats="American actors|Living people|Television personalities" ref="">"It felt like a new day."</quote><quote id="6" author="Oprah Winfrey" cats="American actors|Living people|Television personalities" ref="">I understand why people think we're gay.

"You cannot blame apartheid, your parents, your circumstances, because you are not your circumstances. You are your possibilities. If you know that, you can do anything."</quote><quote id="8" author="Oprah Winfrey" cats="American actors|Living people|Television personalities" ref="">"What other people label or might try to call failure, I have learned is just God's way of pointing you in a new direction."</quote><quote id="9" author="Oprah Winfrey" cats="American actors|Living people|Television personalities" ref="">I know where my lane is, and I know how to stay in my lane. My lane is evolving the consciousness of people. </quote><quote id="10" author="Oprah Winfrey" cats="American actors|Living people|Television personalities" ref="">The thing that I do best is "Be Here. Be Now."</quote><quote id="11" author="Oprah Winfrey" cats="American actors|Living people|Television personalities" ref="">"I believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear."</quote><quote id="12" author="Oprah Winfrey" cats="American actors|Living people|Television personalities" ref="">"She actually is somebody who has the ability to move mountains and change minds."</quote><quote id="13" author="Oprah Winfrey" cats="American actors|Living people|Television personalities" ref="">"Oprah is different.
