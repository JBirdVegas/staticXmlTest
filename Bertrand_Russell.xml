I have really no religion, for my God, being a spirit shown merely by reason to exist, his properties utterly unknown, is no help to my life. I have nor the parson's comfortable doctrine that every good action has its reward, and every sin is forgiven.

It is essential not to discuss whether the first proposition is really true, and not to mention what the anything is, of which it is supposed to be true ... "If" our hypothesis is about "anything", and not about  some one or more particular things, then our deductions constitute mathematics. Thus "mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true." People who have been puzzled by the beginnings of mathematics will, I hope, find comfort in this definition, and will probably agree that it is accurate.</quote><quote id="6" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">[Unlike the] utilitarian... I judge pleasure and pain to be of small importance compared to knowledge, the appreciation and contemplation of beauty, and a certain intrinsic excellence of mind which, apart from its practical effects, appears to me to deserve the name of virtue. [For] many years it seemed to me perfectly self-evident that pleasure is the only good and pain the only evil. Now, however, the opposite seems to me self-evident. 
What first turned me away from utilitarianism was the persuasion that I myself ought to pursue philosophy, although I had (and have still) no doubt that by doing economics and the theory of politics I could add more to human happiness. It appeared to me that the dignity of which human existence is capable is not attainable by devotion to the mechanism of life, and that unless the contemplation of eternal things is preserved, mankind will become no better than well-fed pigs. But I do not believe that such contemplation on the whole tends to happiness. It gives moments of delight, but these are outweighed by years of effort and depression.</quote><quote id="7" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">It seems to me now that "mathematics is capable of an artistic excellence as great as that of any music, perhaps greater"; not because the pleasure it gives (although very pure) is comparable, either in intensity or in the number of people who feel it, to that of music, but because it gives in absolute perfection that combination, characteristic of great art, of godlike freedom, with the sense of inevitable destiny; because, in fact, "it constructs an ideal world where everything is perfect and yet true."</quote><quote id="8" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">Again, in regard to actual human existence, I have found myself giving honour to those who feel its tragedy, who think truly about Death, who are oppressed by ignoble things even when they are inevitable; yet these qualities appear to me to militate against happiness, not only to the possessors, but to all whom they affect. And, generally, the best life seems to me one which thinks truly and feels greatly about human things, and which, in addition, contemplates the world of beauty and of abstract truths. This last is, perhaps, my most anti-utilitarian opinion: I hold all 146px|thumb|right|Philosophy seems to me on the whole a rather hopeless business.

But, in history, so many circumstances of a small and accidental nature are relevant, that no broad and simple uniformities are possible. Where our main endeavour is to discover general laws, we regard these as intrinsically more valuable than any of the facts which they inter-connect. In astronomy, the law of gravitation is plainly better worth knowing than the position of a particular planet on a particular night, or even on every night throughout a year. There are in the law a splendour and simplicity and sense of mastery which illuminate a mass of otherwise uninteresting details... But in history the matter is far otherwise... "Historical facts, many of them, have an intrinsic value, a profound interest on their own account, which makes them worthy of study, quite apart from any possibility of linking them together by means of causal laws."</quote><quote id="15" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">A logical theory may be tested by its capacity for dealing with puzzles, and it is a wholesome plan, in thinking about logic, to stock the mind with as many puzzles as possible, since these serve much the same purpose as is served by experiments in physical science.</quote><quote id="16" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">All's well that ends well; which is the epitaph I should put on my tombstone if I were the last man left alive.</quote><quote id="17" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">The number of syllables in the English names of finite integers tends to increase as the integers grow larger, and must gradually increase indefinitely, since only a finite number of names can be made with a given finite number of syllables. Hence the names of some integers must consist of at least nineteen syllables, and among these there must be a least. Hence "the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables" must denote a definite integer; in fact, it denotes 111, 777. But "the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables" is itself a name consisting of eighteen syllables; hence the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables can be named in eighteen syllables, which is a contradiction. This contradiction was suggested to us by Mr. G. G. Berry of the Bodleian Library.</quote><quote id="18" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">I like mathematics because it is not human and has nothing particular to do with this planet or with the whole accidental universe - because, like Spinoza's God, it won't love us in return.</quote><quote id="19" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">"The above proposition is occasionally useful."</quote><quote id="20" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">When people begin to philosophize they seem to think it necessary to make themselves artificially stupid.</quote><quote id="21" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">People are said to believe in God, or to disbelieve in Adam and Eve. But in such cases what is believed or disbelieved is that there is an entity answering a certain description. This, which can be believed or disbelieved is quite different from the actual entity (if any) which does answer the description. Thus the matter of belief is, in all cases, different in kind from the matter of sensation or presentation, and error is in no way analogous to hallucination. "A hallucination is a fact, not an error; what is erroneous is a judgment based upon it."</quote><quote id="22" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">In the revolt against idealism, the ambiguities of the word “experience” have been perceived, with the result that realists have more and more avoided the word.

Much better, like Archimedes, to be killed because of absorption in eternal things...
There is a possibility in human minds of something mysterious as the night-wind, deep as the sea, calm as the stars, and strong as Death, a mystic contemplation, the "intellectual love of God." Those who have known it cannot "believe" in wars any longer, or in any kind of hot struggle. If I could give to others what has come to me in this way, I could make them too feel the futility of fighting. But I do not know how to communicate it: when I speak, they stare, applaud, or smile, but do not understand.</quote><quote id="31" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">What a queer work the Bible is.
...Some texts are very funny. Deut. XXIV, 5: "When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken." I should never have guessed "cheer up" was a Biblical expression. Here is another really inspiring text: "Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen." St Paul on marriage: "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn." This has remained the doctrine of the Church to this day. It is clear that the Divine purpose in the text "it is better to marry than to burn" is to make us all feel how very dreadful the torments of Hell must be.</quote><quote id="32" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">In the visible world, the Milky Way is a tiny fragment; within this fragment, the solar system is an infinitesimal speck, and of this speck our planet is a microscopic dot.

In science there are many matters about which people are agreed; in philosophy there are none. Therefore, although each proposition in a science may be false, and it is practically certain that there are some that are false, yet we shall be wise to build our philosophy upon science, because the risk of error in philosophy is pretty sure to be greater than in science. If we could hope for certainty in philosophy, the matter would be otherwise, but so far as I can see such a hope would be chimerical.</quote><quote id="41" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">We all have a tendency to think that the world must conform to our prejudices.

What it should produce is a belief that knowledge is attainable in a measure, though with difficulty; that much of what passes for knowledge at any given time is likely to be more or less mistaken, but that the mistakes can be rectified by care and industry. In acting upon our beliefs, we should be very cautious where a small error would mean disaster; nevertheless it is upon our beliefs that we must act. This state of mind is rather difficult: it requires a high degree of intellectual culture without emotional atrophy. But though difficult, it is not impossible; it is in fact the scientific temper. Knowledge, like other good things, is difficult, but not impossible; the dogmatist forgets the difficulty, the skeptic denies the possibility. Both are mistaken, and their errors, when widespread, produce social disaster.</quote><quote id="43" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">The instinctive foundation of the intellectual life is curiosity, which is found among animals in its elementary forms. Intelligence demands an alert curiosity, but it must be of a certain kind. The sort that leads village neighbours to try to peer through curtains after dark has no very high value. The widespread interest in gossip is inspired, not by a love of knowledge but by malice: "no one gossips about other people's secret virtues", but only about their secret vices. Accordingly most gossip is untrue, but care is taken not to verify it. Our neighbour's sins, like the consolations of religion, are so agreeable that we do not stop to scrutinise the evidence closely.</quote><quote id="44" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">I went to Salt Lake City and the Mormons tried to convert me, but when I found they forbade tea and tobacco I thought it was no religion for me.</quote><quote id="45" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">"The place of the father in the modern suburban family is a very small one — particularly if he plays golf", which he usually does.</quote><quote id="46" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">Apart from autograph hunters, I get... many letters from Hindus, beseeching me to adopt some form of mysticism, from young Americans, asking me where I think the line should be drawn in petting, and from Poles, urging me to admit that while all other nationalism may be bad that of Poland is wholly noble.

1. Do not feel absolutely certain of anything. 
2. Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light. 
3. Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed. 
4. When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory. 
5. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found. 
6. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you. 
7. "Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric." 
8. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter. 
9. Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it. 
 10. Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool's paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.</quote><quote id="75" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">Written words differ from spoken words in being material structures.

For what I have said, whether early or late, I do not claim the kind of truth which theologians claim for their creeds.

195px|thumb|right|I have a very simple creed: that life and joy and beauty are better than dusty death.This is an occasion that I hardly know how to find words for. I am more touched than I can say, and more deeply than I can ever hope to express. I have to give my very warmest possible thanks to those who have worked to produce this occasion: to the performers, whose exquisite music, exquisitely performed, was so full of delight; to those who worked in less conspicuous ways, like my friend Mr Schoenman; and to all those who have given me gifts — gifts which are valuable in themselves, and also as expressions of an undying hope for this dangerous world.
"I have a very simple creed: that life and joy and beauty are better than dusty death", and I think when we listen to such music as we heard today we must all of us feel that the capacity to produce such music, and the capacity to hear such music, is a thing worth preserving and should not be thrown away in foolish squabbles. You may say it's a simple creed, but I think everything important is very simple indeed. I've found that creed sufficient, and I should think that a great many of you would also find it sufficient, or else you would hardly be here.
But now I just want to say how it's difficult, when one has embarked upon a course which invites a greater or less degree of persecution and obloquy and abuse, to find instead that one is welcomed as I have been today. It makes one feel rather humble, and I feel I must try to live up to the feelings that have produced this occasion.

But for my part I cannot see any grounds for either. I do not pretend to be able to prove that there is no God. I equally cannot prove Satan is a fiction.

Later, I became acquainted with Lady Welby's work on the subject, but failed to take it seriously. I imagined that logic could be pursued by taking it for granted that symbols were always, so to speak, transparent, and in no way distorted the objects they were supposed to "mean." Purely logical problems have gradually led me further and further from this point of view. Beginning with the question whether the class of all those classes which are not members of themselves is, or is not, a member of itself; continuing with the problem whether the man who says "I am lying" is lying or speaking the truth; passing through the riddle "is the present King of France bald or not bald, or is the law of excluded middle false?" I have now come to believe that the order of words in time or space is an ineradicable part of much of their significance - in fact, that the reason they can express space-time occurrences is that they are space-time occurrences, so that a logic independent of the accidental nature of spacetime becomes an idle dream. These conclusions are unpleasant to my vanity, but pleasant to my love of philosophical activity: until vitality fails, there is no reason to be wedded to one's past theories.

A "thought" is not a social phenomenon, like speech, and therefore does not have the two sides, active and passive, which can be distinguished in speech. I should urge, however, that all the reasons which led our authors to avoid introducing images in explaining meaning should have also led them to avoid introducing "thoughts." If a theory of meaning is to be fitted into natural science as they desire, it is necessary to define the meaning of "words" without introducing anything "mental" in the sense in which what is "mental" is not subject to the laws of physics. Therefore, for the same reasons for which I now hold that the meaning of words should be explained without introducing images -- which I argued to be possible in the above-quoted passage -- I also hold that meaning in general should be treated without introducing "thoughts," and should be regarded as a property of words considered as physical phenomena. Let us therefore amend their theory. They say: "'I am thinking of A' is the same thing as 'My thought is being caused by A.'" Let us substitute: "'I am speaking of A' is the same thing as 'My speech is being caused by A.'"

I am told that that sort of view is depressing, and people will sometimes tell you that if they believed that, they would not be able to go on living. Do not believe it; it is all nonsense.

Vanity is a motive of immense potency. Anyone who has much to do with children knows how they are constantly performing some antic, and saying "Look at me." ""Look at me" is one of the most fundamental desires of the human heart." It can take innumerable forms, from buffoonery to the pursuit of posthumous fame.</quote><quote id="279" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">One of the troubles about vanity is that it grows with what it feeds on. The more you are talked about, the more you will wish to be talked about. The condemned murderer who is allowed to see the account of his trial in the press is indignant if he finds a newspaper which has reported it inadequately. And the more he finds about himself in other newspapers, the more indignant he will be with the one whose reports are meagre. Politicians and literary men are in the same case... It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the influence of vanity throughout the range of human life, from the child of three to the potentate at whose frown the world trembles. Mankind have even committed the impiety of attributing similar desires to the Deity, whom they imagine avid for continual praise. 
But great as is the influence of the motives we have been considering, there is one which outweighs them all. I mean the love of power. Love of power is closely akin to vanity, but it is not by any means the same thing. What vanity needs for its satisfaction is glory, and it is easy to have glory without power. The people who enjoy the greatest glory in the United States are film stars, but they can be put in their place by the Committee for Un-American Activities, which enjoys no glory whatever.</quote><quote id="280" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">Power, like vanity, is insatiable. Nothing short of omnipotence could satisfy it completely. And as it is especially the vice of energetic men, the causal efficacy of love of power is out of all proportion to its frequency. It is, indeed, by far the strongest motive in the lives of important men. 
Love of power is greatly increased by the experience of power, and this applies to petty power as well as to that of potentates.</quote><quote id="281" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">The pursuit of knowledge is, I think, mainly actuated by love of power. And so are all advances in scientific technique. In politics, also, a reformer may have just as strong a love of power as a despot. It would be a complete mistake to decry love of power altogether as a motive. Whether you will be led by this motive to actions which are useful, or to actions which are pernicious, depends upon the social system, and upon your capacities.</quote><quote id="282" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">The politician may change sides so frequently as to find himself always in the majority, but most politicians have a preference for one party to the other, and subordinate their love of power to this preference.</quote><quote id="283" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">A great deal of work is sedentary, and most manual work exercises only a few specialized muscles. When crowds assemble in Trafalgar Square to cheer to the echo an announcement that the government has decided to have them killed, they would not do so if they had all walked twenty-five miles that day. This cure for bellicosity is, however, impracticable, and if the human race is to survive — a thing which is, perhaps, undesirable — other means must be found for securing an innocent outlet for the unused physical energy that produces love of excitement. This is a matter which has been too little considered, both by moralists and by social reformers. The social reformers are of the opinion that they have more serious things to consider. The moralists, on the other hand, are immensely impressed with the seriousness of all the permitted outlets of the love of excitement; the seriousness, however, in their minds, is that of Sin. Dance halls, cinemas, this age of jazz, are all, if we may believe our ears, gateways to Hell, and we should be better employed sitting at home contemplating our sins. I find myself unable to be in entire agreement with the grave men who utter these warnings. The devil has many forms, some designed to deceive the young, some designed to deceive the old and serious. If it is the devil that tempts the young to enjoy themselves, is it not, perhaps, the same personage that persuades the old to condemn their enjoyment? And is not condemnation perhaps merely a form of excitement appropriate to old age? And is it not, perhaps, a drug which — like opium — has to be taken in continually stronger doses to produce the desired effect? Is it not to be feared that, beginning with the wickedness of the cinema, we should be led step by step to condemn the opposite political party, dagoes, wops, Asiatics, and, in short, everybody except the fellow members of our club? And it is from just such condemnations, when widespread, that wars proceed. I have never heard of a war that proceeded from dance halls.</quote><quote id="284" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">What is serious about excitement is that so many of its forms are destructive. It is destructive in those who cannot resist excess in alcohol or gambling. It is destructive when it takes the form of mob violence. And above all it is destructive when it leads to war. It is so deep a need that it will find harmful outlets of this kind unless innocent outlets are at hand. There are such innocent outlets at present in sport, and in politics so long as it is kept within constitutional bounds. But these are not sufficient, especially as the kind of politics that is most exciting is also the kind that does most harm. "Civilized life has grown altogether too tame, and, if it is to be stable, it must provide harmless outlets for the impulses which our remote ancestors satisfied in hunting."</quote><quote id="285" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">It is normal to hate what we fear, and it happens frequently, though not always, that we fear what we hate. I think it may be taken as the rule among primitive men, that they both fear and hate whatever is unfamiliar. They have their own herd, originally a very small one. And within one herd, all are friends, unless there is some special ground of enmity. Other herds are potential or actual enemies; a single member of one of them who strays by accident will be killed. An alien herd as a whole will be avoided or fought according to circumstances. It is this primitive mechanism which still controls our instinctive reaction to foreign nations. The completely untravelled person will view all foreigners as the savage regards a member of another herd. But the man who has travelled, or who has studied international politics, will have discovered that, if his herd is to prosper, it must, to some degree, become amalgamated with other herds.</quote><quote id="286" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">"We love those who hate our enemies, and if we had no enemies there would be very few people whom we should love."
All this, however, is only true so long as we are concerned solely with attitudes towards other human beings. You might regard the soil as your enemy because it yields reluctantly a niggardly subsistence. You might regard Mother Nature in general as your enemy, and envisage human life as a struggle to get the better of Mother Nature. If men viewed life in this way, cooperation of the whole human race would become easy. And men could easily be brought to view life in this way if schools, newspapers, and politicians devoted themselves to this end. But schools are out to teach patriotism; newspapers are out to stir up excitement; and politicians are out to get re-elected. None of the three, therefore, can do anything towards saving the human race from reciprocal suicide.</quote><quote id="287" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">There are two ways of coping with fear: one is to diminish the external danger, and the other is to cultivate Stoic endurance. The latter can be reinforced, except where immediate action is necessary, by turning our thoughts away from the cause of fear. The conquest of fear is of very great importance. Fear is in itself degrading; it easily becomes an obsession; it produces hate of that which is feared, and it leads headlong to excesses of cruelty. Nothing has so beneficent an effect on human beings as security. If an international system could be established which would remove the fear of war, the improvement in everyday mentality of everyday people would be enormous and very rapid. Fear, at present, overshadows the world. The atom bomb and the bacterial bomb, wielded by the wicked communist or the wicked capitalist as the case may be, make Washington and the Kremlin tremble, and drive men further along the road toward the abyss. If matters are to improve, the first and essential step is to find a way of diminishing fear.</quote><quote id="288" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">The world at present is obsessed by the conflict of rival ideologies, and one of the apparent causes of conflict is the desire for the victory of our own ideology and the defeat of the other.

It is obvious that modern war is not good business from a financial point of view. Although we won both the world wars, we should now be much richer if they had not occured. "If men were actuated by self-interest, which they are not — except in the case of a few saints — the whole human race would cooperate." There would be no more wars, no more armies, no more navies, no more atom bombs. There would not be armies of propagandists employed in poisoning the minds of Nation A against Nation B, and reciprocally of Nation B against Nation A. There would not be armies of officials at frontiers to prevent the entry of foreign books and foreign ideas, however excellent in themselves. There would not be customs barriers to ensure the existence of many small enterprises where one big enterprise would be more economic. "All this would happen very quickly if men desired their own happiness as ardently as they desired the misery of their neighbors." But, you will tell me, what is the use of these utopian dreams? Moralists will see to it that we do not become wholly selfish, and until we do the millennium will be impossible.</quote><quote id="293" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">I do not wish to seem to end upon a note of cynicism. I do not deny that there are better things than selfishness, and that some people achieve these things. I maintain, however, on the one hand, that there are few occasions upon which large bodies of men, such as politics is concerned with, can rise above selfishness, while, on the other hand, there are a very great many circumstances in which populations will fall below selfishness, if selfishness is interpreted as enlightened self-interest.
And among those occasions on which people fall below self-interest are most of the occasions on which they are convinced that they are acting from idealistic motives. "Much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power." When you see large masses of men swayed by what appear to be noble motives, it is as well to look below the surface and ask yourself what it is that makes these motives effective. It is partly because it is so easy to be taken in by a facade of nobility that a psychological inquiry, such as I have been attempting, is worth making. I would say, in conclusion, that if what I have said is right, "the main thing needed to make the world happy is intelligence".

Within the framework of classical economics there was no solution. Roosevelt saved the situation by bold and heretical action. He spent billions of public money and created a huge public debt, but by so doing he revived production and brought his country out of the depression. Businessmen, who in spite of such a sharp lesson continued to believe in old-fashioned economics, were infinitely shocked, and although Roosevelt saved them from ruin, they continued to curse him and to speak of him as 'the madman in the White House.'

Human beings have certain capacities for spontaneous enjoyment, but moralists and pedants possess themselves of the apparatus of these enjoyments, and having extracted what they consider the poison of pleasure they leave them dreary and dismal and devoid of everything that gives them value. Shakespeare did not write with a view to boring school-children; he wrote with a view to delighting his audiences. If he does not give you delight, you had better ignore him.</quote><quote id="298" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">Man, in the long ages since he descended from the trees, has passed arduously and perilously through a vast dusty desert, surrounded by the whitening bones of those who have perished by the way, maddened by hunger and thirst, by fear of wild beasts, by dread of enemies, not only living enemies, but spectres of dead rivals projected on to the dangerous world by the intensity of his own fears. At last he has emerged from the desert into a smiling land, but in the long night he has forgotten how to smile. We cannot believe in the brightness of the morning. We think it trivial and deceptive; we cling to old myths that allow us to go on living with fear and hate — above all, hate of ourselves, miserable sinners. This is folly. "Man now needs for his salvation only one thing: to open his heart to joy, and leave fear to gibber through the glimmering darkness of a forgotten past." He must lift up his eyes and say: "No, I am not a miserable sinner; I am a being who, by a long and arduous road, has discovered how to make intelligence master natural obstacles, how to live in freedom and joy, at peace with myself and therefore with all mankind." This will happen if men choose joy rather than sorrow. If not, eternal death will bury man in deserved oblivion.</quote><quote id="299" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">"It is not by prayer and humility that you cause things to go as you wish, but by acquiring a knowledge of natural laws."</quote><quote id="300" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">Science, ever since the time of the Arabs, has had two functions: (1) to enable us to "know" things, and (2) to enable us to "do" things.</quote><quote id="301" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">Some part of life — perhaps the most important part — must be left to the spontaneous action of individual impulse, for where all is system there will be mental and spiritual death.</quote><quote id="302" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">If throughout your life you abstain from murder, theft, fornication, perjury, blasphemy, and disrespect toward your parents, your church, and your king, you are conventionally held to deserve moral admiration even if you have never done a single kind or generous or useful action.

It is feared that if many H-bombs are used there will be universal death, sudden only for a minority, but for the majority a slow torture of disease and disintegration.
Many warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon the extent of the particular expert's knowledge.

People will not face this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.
The abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the term "mankind" feels vague and abstract. "People scarcely realize in imagination that the danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually, and those whom they love are in imminent danger of perishing agonizingly." And so they hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are prohibited.
This hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would inevitably be victorious.</quote><quote id="313" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">Most of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that, if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by war.

I had no experience of the social pleasures of boyhood and did not miss them. But I liked mathematics, and mathematics was suspect because it has no ethical content. I came also to disagree with the theological opinions of my family, and as I grew up I became increasingly interested in philosophy, of which they profoundly disapproved. Every time the subject came up they repeated with unfailing regularity, 'What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.' After some fifty or sixty repetitions, this remark ceased to amuse me.</quote><quote id="317" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">I think the first thing that led me toward philosophy (though at that time the word 'philosophy' was still unknown to me) occurred at the age of eleven. My childhood was mainly solitary as my only brother was seven years older than I was. No doubt as a result of much solitude I became rather solemn, with a great deal of time for thinking but not much knowledge for my thoughtfulness to exercise itself upon. I had, though I was not yet aware of it, the pleasure in demonstrations which is typical of the mathematical mind. After I grew up I found others who felt as I did on this matter. My friend G. H. Hardy, who was professor of pure mathematics, enjoyed this pleasure in a very high degree. He told me once that if he could find a proof that I was going to die in five minutes he would of course be sorry to lose me, but this sorrow would be quite outweighed by pleasure in the proof. I entirely sympathized with him and was not at all offended. Before I began the study of geometry somebody had told me that it proved things and this caused me to feel delight when my brother said he would teach it to me. Geometry in those days was still 'Euclid.' My brother began at the beginning with the definitions. These I accepted readily enough. But he came next to the axioms. 'These,' he said, 'can't be proved, but they have to be assumed before the rest can be proved.' At these words my hopes crumbled. I had thought it would be wonderful to find something that one could prove, and then it turned out that this could only be done by means of assumptions of which there was no proof. I looked at my brother with a sort of indignation and said: 'But why should I admit these things if they can't be proved?' He replied, 'Well, if you won't, we can't go on.'</quote><quote id="318" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">My first advice (on how "not" to grow old) would be to choose you ancestors carefully.

I thought that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics than elsewhere. But I discovered that many mathematical demonstrations, which my teachers expected me to accept, were full of fallacies, and that, if certainty were indeed discoverable in mathematics, it would be in a new field of mathematics, with more solid foundations than those that had hitherto been thought secure. But as the work proceeded, I was continually reminded of the fable about the elephant and the tortoise. having constructed an elephant upon which the mathematical world could rest, I found the elephant tottering, and proceeded to construct a tortoise to keep the elephant from falling. But the tortoise was no more secure than the elephant, and after some twenty years of very arduous toil, I came to the conclusion that there was nothing more that I could do in the way of making mathematical knowledge indubitable.</quote><quote id="320" author="Bertrand Russell" cats="1970s deaths|Activists|Autobiographers|English people|Logicians|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Philosophers" ref="">Some modern philosophers have gone so far as to say that words should never be confronted with facts but should live in a pure, autonomous world where they are compared only with other words.

...Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be.
