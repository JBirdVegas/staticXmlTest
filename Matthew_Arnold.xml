For in a "man" style is the saying in the best way "what you have to say." "The "what you have to say" depends on your age."  In the 17th century it was "a smaller harvest than now," and sooner to be reaped; and therefore to its reaper was left time to stow it more finely and curiously.  Still more was this the case in the ancient world.  "The poet's matter being "the hitherto experience of the world, and his own," increases with every century."</quote><quote id="2" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">"Who prop, thou ask'st in these bad days, my mind?"

And Tmolus hill, and Smyrna bay, though blind.</quote><quote id="3" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">But be his

Out-topping knowledge.</quote><quote id="5" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know, 
Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure, 
Didst tread on earth unguess'd at. — Better so! &lt;p&gt; All pains the immortal spirit must endure, 
All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow, 
Find their sole speech in that victorious brow.</quote><quote id="6" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">"The will is free;

"Not till the hours of light return

To unlock the heart, and let it speak?"
Are even lovers powerless to reveal
To one another what indeed they feel?
I knew the mass of men conceal'd
Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd
They would by other men be met
With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;
"I knew they lived and moved
Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest
Of men, and alien to themselves — and yet
The same heart beats in every human breast!"</quote><quote id="13" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">But often, in the world’s most crowded streets,
But often, in the din of strife,

After the knowledge of our buried life;
A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
In tracking out our true, original course;
A longing to inquire
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
So wild, so deep in us, to know
Whence our lives come and where they go.</quote><quote id="14" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">And long we try in vain to speak and act

The poet's feverish blood;

Those, certainly, which most powerfully appeal to the great primary human affections: to those elementary feelings which subsist permanently in the race, and which are independent of time."

Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
Where ignorant armies clash by night."</quote><quote id="102" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">Creep into thy narrow bed,
Creep, and let no more be said!</quote><quote id="103" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">"Let the long contention cease!

The autumn evening. The Field
Strewn with its dank yellow drifts

From a few boys late at their play!</quote><quote id="106" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">O strong soul, by what shore

Of mortal men on the earth?—
Most men eddy about
Here and there—eat and drink,
Chatter and love and hate,
Gather and squander, are raised
Aloft, are hurl’d in the dust,
Striving blindly, achieving
Nothing; and, then they die—
Perish; and no one asks
Who or what they have been,
More than he asks what waves
In the moonlit solitudes mild
Of the midmost Ocean, have swell’d,
Foam’d for a moment, and gone.</quote><quote id="108" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">Therefore to thee it was given

O faithful shepherd! to come,
Bringing thy sheep in thy hand.</quote><quote id="109" author="Matthew Arnold" cats="1880s deaths|Critics|English playwrights|English poets|Romantic poets" ref="">"Radiant with ardour divine!
