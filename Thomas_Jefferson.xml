The only method of doing this is to assume a perfect resignation to the Divine will, to consider that whatever does happen, must happen; and that by our uneasiness, we cannot prevent the blow before it does fall, but we may add to its force after it has fallen.  These considerations, and others such as these, may enable us in some measure to surmount the difficulties thrown in our way; to bear up with a tolerable degree of patience under this burthen of life; and to proceed with a pious and unshaken resignation, till we arrive at our journey’s end, when we may deliver up our trust into the hands of him who gave it, and receive such reward as to him shall seem proportioned to our merit. Such, dear Page, will be the language of the man who considers his situation in this life, and such should be the language of every man who would wish to render that situation as easy as the nature of it will admit. Few things will disturb him at all: nothing will disturb him much.</quote><quote id="2" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Christianity neither is, nor ever was, a part of the common law.</quote><quote id="3" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">"A lively and lasting sense of filial duty is more effectually impressed on the mind of a son or daughter by reading "King Lear", than by all the dry volumes of ethics, and divinity, that ever were written."</quote><quote id="4" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">"The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time; the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them."</quote><quote id="5" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Let those flatter, who fear: it is not an American art.</quote><quote id="6" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">"Our cause is just." Our union is perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable. — We gratefully acknowledge, as signal instances of the Divine favour towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverence, employ for the preservation of our liberties; "being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves."</quote><quote id="7" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">"All persons shall have full and free liberty of religious opinion; nor shall any be compelled to frequent or maintain any religious institution."</quote><quote id="8" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">"No freeman shall be debarred the use of arms [within his own lands]."</quote><quote id="9" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">"Truth will do well enough if left to shift for herself."

Shall we suffer a Pagan to deal with us and not suffer him to pray to his god? Why have Christians been distinguished above all people who have ever lived, for persecutions? Is it because it is the genius of their religion? No, its genius is the reverse. It is the refusing toleration to those of a different opinion which has produced all the bustles and wars on account of religion. It was the misfortune of mankind that during the darker centuries the Christian priests following their ambition and avarice combining with the magistrate to divide the spoils of the people, could establish the notion that schismatics might be ousted of their possessions &amp; destroyed.

I am not a Federalist, because "I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in anything else where I was capable of thinking for myself.  Such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent. If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all."

They are not qualified to exercise themselves the EXECUTIVE department: but they are qualified to name the person who shall exercise it. With us therefore they chuse this officer every 4. years. 2. They are not qualified to LEGISLATE. With us therefore they only chuse the legislators. 3. They are not qualified to JUDGE questions of law; but they are very capable of judging questions of fact. In the form of JURIES therefore they determine all matters of fact, leaving to the permanent judges to decide the law resulting from those facts. Butwe all know that permanent judges acquire an esprit de corps; that, being known, they are liable to be tempted by bribery; that they are misled by favor, by relationship, by a spirit of party, by a devotion to the executive or legislative; that "it is better to leave a cause to the decision of cross and pile than to that of a judge biased to one side"; and that the opinion of twelve honest jurymen gives still a better hope of right than cross and pile does. It is left therefore, to the juries, if they think the permanent judges are under any bias whatever in any cause, to take on themselves to judge the law as well as the fact. They never exercise this power but when they suspect partiality in the judges; and by the exercise of this power they have been the firmest bulwarks of English liberty.</quote><quote id="46" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">"I say, the earth belongs to each of these generations during its course, fully and in its own right.

While this gives a moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independence to the mind.

The testimony of the writer weighs in their favor, in one scale, and their not being against the laws of nature, does not weigh against them. But those facts in the Bible which contradict the laws of nature, must be examined with more care, and under a variety of faces. Here you must recur to the pretensions of the writer to inspiration from God. Examine upon what evidence his pretensions are founded, and whether that evidence is so strong, as that its falsehood would be more improbable than a change in the laws of nature, in the case he relates. For example in the book of Joshua we are told the sun stood still several hours. Were we to read that fact in Livy or Tacitus we should class it with their showers of blood, speaking of statues, beasts, etc. "But it is said that the writer of that book was inspired. Examine therefore candidly what evidence there is of his having been inspired. The pretension is entitled to your inquiry, because millions believe it." On the other hand you are astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law of nature that a body revolving on its axis as the earth does, should have stopped, should not by that sudden stoppage have prostrated animals, trees, buildings, and should after a certain time have resumed its revolution, &amp; that without a second general prostration.

The disadvantages under which his doctrines appear are remarkable.
1. Like  Xenophon or an Arrian to write for him. On the contrary, all the learned of his country, entrenched in its power and riches, were opposed to him, lest his labors should undermine their advantages; and the committing to writing his life &amp; doctrines fell on the most unlettered &amp; ignorant men; who wrote, too, from memory, &amp; not till long after the transactions had passed.
3. According to the ordinary fate of those who attempt to enlighten and reform mankind, he fell an early victim to the jealousy &amp; combination of the altar and the throne, at about 33. years of age, his reason having not yet attained the maximum of its energy, nor the course of his preaching, which was but of 3. years at most, presented occasions for developing a complete system of morals.
4. Hence the doctrines which he really delivered were defective as a whole, and fragments only of what he did deliver have come to us mutilated, misstated, &amp; often unintelligible.
5. They have been still more disfigured by the corruptions of schismatising followers, who have found an interest in sophisticating &amp; perverting the simple doctrines he taught by engrafting on them the mysticisms of a Grecian sophist, frittering them into subtleties, &amp; obscuring them with jargon, until they have caused good men to reject the whole in disgust, &amp; to view Jesus himself as an impostor.
Notwithstanding these disadvantages, a system of morals is presented to us, which, if filled up in the true style and spirit of the rich fragments he left us, would be the most perfect and sublime that has ever been taught by man.
The question of his being a member of the Godhead, or in direct communication with it, claimed for him by some of his followers, and denied by others, is foreign to the present view, which is merely an estimate of the intrinsic merit of his doctrines.
1. He corrected the Deism of the Jews, confirming them in their belief of one only God, and giving them juster notions of his attributes and government.
2. His moral doctrines, relating to kindred &amp; friends, were more pure &amp; perfect than those of the most correct of the philosophers, and greatly more so than those of the Jews; and they went far beyond both in inculcating universal philanthropy, not only to kindred and friends, to neighbors and countrymen, but to all mankind, gathering all into one family, under the bonds of love, charity, peace, common wants and common aids. A development of this head will evince the peculiar superiority of the system of Jesus over all others.
3. The precepts of philosophy, &amp; of the Hebrew code, laid hold of actions only. He pushed his scrutinies into the heart of man; erected his tribunal in the region of his thoughts, and purified the waters at the fountain head.
4. He taught, emphatically, the doctrines of a future state, which was either doubted, or disbelieved by the Jews; and wielded it with efficacy, as an important incentive, supplementary to the other motives to moral conduct.</quote><quote id="106" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">I never will, by any word or act, bow to the shrine of intolerance, or admit a right of inquiry into the religious opinions of others.</quote><quote id="107" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">"There is no act, however virtuous, for which ingenuity may not find some bad motive."</quote><quote id="108" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">The inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to the principles of the Federal constitution, to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages, and immunities, of citizens of the United States; and, in the mean time, they shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the religion which they profess.</quote><quote id="109" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">The Constitution has made no provision for our holding foreign territory, still less for incorporating foreign nations into our Union.

Their credit once established, others might be emitted, bottomed also on a tax, but not bearing interest; and if ever their credit faltered, open public loans, on which these bills alone should be received as specie. These, operating as a sinking fund, would reduce the quantity in circulation, so as to maintain that in an equilibrium with specie.

Here are a set of people, for instance, who have bestowed on us the great blessing of running in our debt about two hundred millions of dollars, without our knowing who they are, where they are, or what property they have to pay this debt when called on; nay, who have made us so sensible of the blessings of letting them run in our debt, that we have exempted them by law from the repayment of these debts beyond a give proportion (generally estimated at one-third). And to fill up the measure of blessing, instead of paying, they receive an interest on what they owe from those to whom they owe; for all the notes, or evidences of what they owe, which we see in circulation, have been lent to somebody on an interest which is levied again on us through the medium of commerce. And they are so ready still to deal out their liberalities to us, that they are now willing to let themselves run in our debt ninety millions more, on our paying them the same premium of six or eight per cent interest, and on the same legal exemption from the repayment of more than thirty millions of the debt, when it shall be called for.</quote><quote id="198" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">But it will be asked, are we to have no banks?

We are warranted, then, in affirming that this parody on the principle of 'a public debt being a public blessing,' and its mutation into the blessing of private instead of public debts, is as ridiculous as the original principle itself.

Even banks of deposit, where cash should be lodged, and a paper acknowledgment taken out as its representative, entitled to a return of the cash on demand, would be convenient for remittances, travelling persons, etc. But, liable as its cash would be to be pilfered and robbed, and its paper to be fraudulently re-issued, or issued without deposit, it would require skilful and strict regulation.</quote><quote id="203" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">"The mother principle [is] that 'governments are republican only in proportion as they embody the will of their people, and execute it.'"".</quote><quote id="204" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">But inequality of representation in both Houses of our legislature, is not the only republican heresy in this first essay of our revolutionary patriots at forming a constitution.

But in a government founded on the public will, this principle operates in an opposite direction, and against that will. There, too, they were still removable on a concurrence of the executive and legislative branches. But we have made them independent of the nation itself. They are irremovable, but by their own body, for any depravities of conduct, and even by their own body for the imbecilities of dotage. The justices of the inferior courts are self- chosen, are for life, and perpetuate their own body in succession forever, so that a faction once possessing themselves of the bench of a county, can never be broken up, but hold their county in chains, forever indissoluble. Yet these justices are the real executive as well as judiciary, in all our minor and most ordinary concerns. They tax us at will; fill the office of sheriff, the most important of all the executive officers of the county; name nearly all our military leaders, which leaders, once named, are removable but by themselves. The juries, our judges of all fact, and of law when they choose it, are not selected by the people, nor amenable to them. They are chosen by an officer named by the court and executive. Chosen, did I say? Picked up by the sheriff from the loungings of the court yard, after everything respectable has retired from it. Where then is our republicanism to be found? Not in our constitution certainly, but merely in the spirit of our people. That would oblige even a despot to govern us republicanly. Owing to this spirit, and to nothing in the form of our constitution, all things have gone well. But this fact, so triumphantly misquoted by the enemies of reformation, is not the fruit of our constitution, but has prevailed in spite of it.

They, and not the rich, are our dependence for continued freedom. And to preserve their independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude." If we run into such debts, as that we must be taxed in our meat and in our drink, in our necessaries and our comforts, in our labors and our amusements, for our callings and our creeds, as the people of England are, our people, like them, must come to labor sixteen hours in the twenty-four, give the earnings of fifteen of these to the government for their debts and daily expenses; and the sixteenth being insufficient to afford us bread, we must live, as they now do, on oatmeal and potatoes; have no time to think, no means of calling the mismanagers to account; but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow-sufferers. Our landholders, too, like theirs, retaining indeed the title and stewardship of estates called theirs, but held really in trust for the treasury, must wander, like theirs, in foreign countries, and be contented with penury, obscurity, exile, and the glory of the nation. This example reads to us the salutary lesson, that "private fortunes are destroyed by public as well as by private extravagance. And this is the tendency of all human governments. A departure from principle in one instance becomes a precedent for a second; that second for a third; and so on, till the bulk of the society is reduced to be mere automatons of misery, and to have no sensibilities left but for sinning and suffering. Then begins, indeed, the bellum omnium in omnia, which some philosophers observing to be so general in this world, have mistaken it for the natural, instead of the abusive state of man.

I give no credit to their falsifications of his actions and doctrines, and to rescue his character, the postulate in my letter asked only what is granted in reading every other historian. ... "I say, that this free exercise of reason is all I ask for the vindication of the character of Jesus." We find in the writings of his biographers matter of two distinct descriptions. First, a groundwork of vulgar ignorance, of things impossible, of superstitions, fanaticisms and fabrications. Intermixed with these, again, are sublime ideas of the Supreme Being, aphorisms and precepts of the purest morality and benevolence, sanctioned by a life of humility, innocence and simplicity of manners, neglect of riches, absence of worldly ambition and honors, with an eloquence and persuasiveness which have not been surpassed. "These could not be inventions of the groveling authors who relate them. They are far beyond the powers of their feeble minds. They shew that there was a character, the subject of their history, whose splendid conceptions were above all suspicion of being interpolations from their hands." Can we be at a loss in separating such materials, and ascribing each to its genuine author? The difference is obvious to the eye and to the understanding, and we may read as we run to each his part; and I will venture to affirm, that he who, as I have done, will undertake to winnow this grain from its chaff, will find it not to require a moment's consideration. The parts fall asunder of themselves, as would those of an image of metal and clay. ... "There are, I acknowledge, passages not free from objection, which we may, with probability, ascribe to Jesus himself; but claiming indulgence from the circumstances under which he acted." His object was the reformation of some articles in the religion of the Jews, as taught by Moses. That sect had presented for the object of their worship, a being of terrific character, cruel, vindictive, capricious and unjust. Jesus, taking for his type the best qualities of the human head and heart, wisdom, justice, goodness, and adding to them power, ascribed all of these, but in infinite perfection, to the Supreme Being, and formed him really worthy of their adoration. Moses had either not believed in a future state of existence, or had not thought it essential to be explicitly taught to his people. Jesus inculcated that doctrine with emphasis and precision. Moses had bound the Jews to many idle ceremonies, mummeries and observances, of no effect towards producing the social utilities which constitute the essence of virtue; Jesus exposed their futility and insignificance. The one instilled into his people the most anti-social spirit towards other nations; the other preached philanthropy and universal charity and benevolence. The office of reformer of the superstitions of a nation, is ever dangerous. Jesus had to walk on the perilous confines of reason and religion: and a step to right or left might place him within the gripe of the priests of the superstition, a blood thirsty race, as cruel and remorseless as the being whom they represented as the family God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob, and the local God of Israel. They were constantly laying snares, too, to entangle him in the web of the law. He was justifiable, therefore, in avoiding these by evasions, by sophisms, by misconstructions and misapplications of scraps of the prophets, and in defending himself with these their own weapons, as sufficient, ad homines, at least. "That Jesus did not mean to impose himself on mankind as the son of God, physically speaking, I have been convinced by the writings of men more learned than myself in that lore. But that he might conscientiously believe himself inspired from above, is very possible."</quote><quote id="218" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings.

On the establishment of the Bank of the United States, this was the great ground on which that establishment was combated; and the party prevailing supported it only on the argument of its being an incident to the power given them for raising money.</quote><quote id="280" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">That we are overdone with banking institutions which have banished the precious metals and substituted a more fluctuating and unsafe medium, that these have withdrawn capital from useful improvements and employments to nourish idleness, that the wars of the world have swollen our commerce beyond the wholesome limits of exchanging our own productions for our own wants, and that, for the emolument of a small proportion of our society who prefer these demoralizing pursuits to labors useful to the whole, the peace of the whole is endangered and all our present difficulties produced, are evils more easily to be deplored than remedied.</quote><quote id="281" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">The idea of creating a national bank I do not concur in, because it seems now decided that Congress has not that power (although I sincerely wish they had it exclusively), and because I think there is already a vast redundancy rather than a scarcity of paper medium.</quote><quote id="282" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Everything predicted by the enemies of banks, in the beginning, is now coming to pass. We are to be ruined now by the deluge of bank paper. It is cruel that such revolutions in private fortunes should be at the mercy of avaricious adventurers, who, instead of employing their capital, if any they have, in manufactures, commerce, and other useful pursuits, make it an instrument to burden all the interchanges of property with their swindling profits, profits which are the price of no useful industry of theirs.</quote><quote id="283" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">I am an enemy to all banks discounting bills or notes for anything but coin.</quote><quote id="284" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Necessity, as well as patriotism and confidence, will make us all eager to receive treasury notes, if founded on specific taxes. Congress may borrow of the public, and without interest, all the money they may want, to the amount of a competent circulation, by merely issuing their own promissory notes, of proper denominations for the larger purposes of circulation, but not for the small. Leave that door open for the entrance of metallic money.</quote><quote id="285" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">The State legislatures should be immediately urged to relinquish the right of establishing banks of discount. Most of them will comply, on patriotic principles, under the convictions of the moment; and the non-complying may be crowded into concurrence by legitimate devices.</quote><quote id="286" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Instead of funding issues of paper on the hypothecation of specific redeeming taxes (the only method of anticipating, in a time of war, the resources of times of peace, tested by the experience of nations), we are trusting to tricks of jugglers on the cards, to the illusions of banking schemes for the resources of the war, and for the cure of colic to inflations of more wind.</quote><quote id="287" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Treasury notes of small as well as high denomination, bottomed on a tax which would redeem them in ten years, would place at our disposal the whole circulating medium of the United States... The public... ought never more to permit its being filched from them by private speculators and disorganizers of the circulation.</quote><quote id="288" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">I hope we shall... crush in it’s birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country</quote><quote id="289" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Put down the banks, and if this country could not be carried through the longest war against her most powerful enemy without ever knowing the want of a dollar, without dependence on the traitorous classes of her citizens, without bearing hard on the resources of the people, or loading the public with an indefinite burden of debt, I know nothing of my countrymen. Not by any novel project, not by any "charlatanerie", but by ordinary and well-experienced means; by the total prohibition of all private paper at all times, by reasonable taxes in war aided by the necessary emissions of public paper of circulating size, this bottomed on special taxes, redeemable annually as this special tax comes in, and finally within a moderate period.</quote><quote id="290" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Our people... will give you all the necessaries of war they produce, if, instead of the bankrupt trash they now are obliged to receive for want of any other, you will give them a paper promise funded on a specific pledge, and of a size for common circulation.</quote><quote id="291" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">The system of banking we have both equally and ever reprobated. I contemplate it as a blot left in all our constitutions, which, if not covered, will end in their destruction, which is already hit by the gamblers in corruption, and is sweeping away in its progress the fortunes and morals of our citizens.</quote><quote id="292" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">The bank mania is one of the most threatening of these imitations. It is raising up a moneyed aristocracy in our country which has already set the government at defiance, and although forced at length to yield a little on this first essay of their strength, their principles are unyielded and unyielding. These have taken deep root in the hearts of that class from which our legislators are drawn, and the sop to Cerberus from fable has become history. Their principles lay hold of the good, their pelf of the bad, and thus those whom the Constitution had placed as guards to its portals, are sophisticated or suborned from their duties.</quote><quote id="293" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Nearly all of it is now called in by the banks, who have the regulation of the safety-valves of our fortunes, and who condense and explode them at their will.</quote><quote id="294" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Certainly no nation ever before abandoned to the avarice and jugglings of private individuals to regulate according to their own interests, the quantum of circulating medium for the nation — to inflate, by deluges of paper, the nominal prices of property, and then to buy up that property at 1s. in the pound, having first withdrawn the floating medium which might endanger a competition in purchase. Yet this is what has been done, and will be done, unless stayed by the protecting hand of the legislature. The evil has been produced by the error of their sanction of this ruinous machinery of banks; and justice, wisdom, duty, all require that they should interpose and arrest it before the schemes of plunder and spoliation desolate the country.</quote><quote id="295" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">Put down all banks, admit none but a metallic circulation that will take its proper level with the like circulation in other countries, and then our manufacturers may work in fair competition with those of other countries, and the import duties which the government may lay for the purposes of revenue will so far place them above equal competition.</quote><quote id="296" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">There can be no safer deposit on earth than the Treasury of the United States.</quote><quote id="297" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">I have always said, and always will say, that the studious perusal of the sacred volume will make better citizens, better fathers, and better husbands.</quote><quote id="298" author="Thomas Jefferson" cats="1820s deaths|Founding Fathers|United States Presidents|United States Secretaries of State|Virginians" ref="">The habit of using "ardent spirit", by men in public office, has occasioned more injury to the public service, and more trouble to me, than any other circumstance which has occurred in the internal concerns of the country, during my administration. And were I to commence my administration again, with the knowledge which from experience I have acquired, the first question which I would ask, with regard to every candidate for public office, should be, ""Is he addicted to the use of ardent spirit?""</quote></quotes>
