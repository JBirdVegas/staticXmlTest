Those on the other hand who have taken a contrary course, and asserted that absolutely nothing can be known — whether it were from hatred of the ancient sophists, or from uncertainty and fluctuation of mind, or even from a kind of fullness of learning, that they fell upon this opinion — have certainly advanced reasons for it that are not to be despised; but yet they have neither started from true principles nor rested in the just conclusion, zeal and affectation having carried them much too far....
Now my method, though hard to practice, is easy to explain; and it is this. I propose to establish progressive stages of certainty. The evidence of the sense, helped and guarded by a certain process of correction, I retain. But the mental operation which follows the act of sense I for the most part reject; and instead of it "I open and lay out a new and certain path for the mind to proceed in, starting directly from the simple sensuous perception."</quote><quote id="30" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">We are wont to call that human reasoning which we apply to Nature the "anticipation of Nature" (as being rash and premature) and that which is properly deduced from things the "interpretation of Nature".</quote><quote id="31" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"Man, being the servant and interpreter of Nature, can do and understand so much and so much only as he has observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature.

The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable, proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. "The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but as yet untried."</quote><quote id="37" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"It cannot be that axioms established by argumentation should avail for the discovery of new works, since the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument."

The first is of those who desire to extend their own power in their native country, a vulgar and degenerate kind. The second is of those who labor to extend the power and dominion of their country among men. This certainly has more dignity, though not less covetousness. But if a man endeavor to establish and extend the power and dominion of the human race itself over the universe, his ambition (if ambition it can be called) is without doubt both a more wholesome and a more noble thing than the other two. Now the empire of man over things depends wholly on the arts and sciences. For "we cannot command nature except by obeying her."</quote><quote id="39" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"There are four classes of Idols which beset men's minds." To these for distinction's sake I have assigned names — calling the first class, Idols of the Tribe ; the second, Idols of the Cave; the third, Idols of the Market-Place; the fourth, Idols of the Theater.</quote><quote id="40" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"The Idols of Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself, and in the tribe or race of men. For it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things." On the contrary, all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe. And "the human understanding is like a false mirror, which, receiving rays irregularly, distorts and discolors the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it."</quote><quote id="41" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"The Idols of the Cave are the idols of the individual man. For everyone (besides the errors common to human nature in general) has a cave or den of his own, which refracts and discolors the light of nature, owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature; or to his education and conversation with others"; or to the reading of books, and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires; or to the differences of impressions, accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled; or the like. So that the spirit of man (according as it is meted out to different individuals) is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation, and governed as it were by chance. Whence it was well observed by Heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds, and not in the greater or common world.</quote><quote id="42" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"There are also Idols formed by the intercourse and association of men with each other, which I call Idols of the Market Place, on account of the commerce and consort of men there." For it is by discourse that men associate, and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar. And therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding. Nor do the definitions or explanations wherewith in some things learned men are wont to guard and defend themselves, by any means set the matter right. "But words plainly force and overrule the understanding, and throw all into confusion, and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies."</quote><quote id="43" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"Lastly, there are Idols which have immigrated into men's minds from the various dogmas of philosophies, and also from wrong laws of demonstration. These I call Idols of the Theater, because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stage plays, representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion."</quote><quote id="44" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"The human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds." And though there be many things in nature which are singular and unmatched, yet it devises for them parallels and conjugates and relatives which do not exist. Hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles, spirals and dragons being (except in name) utterly rejected.</quote><quote id="45" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion" (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side, "yet these it either neglects and despises," or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects," in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate."</quote><quote id="46" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">…it is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human understanding to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives…</quote><quote id="47" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">The human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly, and so fill the imagination; and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow, though it cannot see how, similar to those few things by which it is surrounded.</quote><quote id="48" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">The human understanding is unquiet; it cannot stop or rest, and still presses onward, but in vain. Therefore it is that "we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world, but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond..." But he is no less an unskilled and shallow philosopher who seeks causes of that which is most general, than he who in things subordinate and subaltern omits to do so.</quote><quote id="49" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">But by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness, incompetency, and deceptions of the senses; in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it, though they be more important. Hence it is that speculation commonly ceases where sight ceases; insomuch that of things invisible there is little or no observation.</quote><quote id="50" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">But the best demonstration by far is experience, if it go not beyond the actual experiment.</quote><quote id="51" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"It is not possible to run a course aright when the goal itself has not been rightly placed."</quote><quote id="52" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"But by far the greatest obstacle to the progress of science and to the undertaking of new tasks and provinces therein is found in this — that men despair and think things impossible."</quote><quote id="53" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"Those who have handled sciences have been either men of experiment or men of dogmas. The men of experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance. But the bee takes a middle course: it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and of the field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own." Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy; for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical experiments and lay it up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it up in the understanding altered and digested. "Therefore from a closer and purer league between these two faculties, the experimental and the rational (such as has never yet been made), much may be hoped."</quote><quote id="54" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"No one has yet been found so firm of mind and purpose as resolutely to compel himself to sweep away all theories and common notions, and to apply the understanding, thus made fair and even, to a fresh examination of particulars." Thus it happens that human knowledge, as we have it, is a mere medley and ill-digested mass, made up of much credulity and much accident, and also of the childish notions which we at first imbibed.</quote><quote id="55" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"Another argument of hope may be drawn from this — that some of the inventions already known are such as before they were discovered it could hardly have entered any man's head to think of; they would have been simply set aside as impossible." For in conjecturing what may be men set before them the example of what has been, and divine of the new with an imagination preoccupied and colored by the old; which way of forming opinions is very fallacious, for "streams that are drawn from the springheads of nature do not always run in the old channels."</quote><quote id="56" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">"There is another ground of hope that must not be omitted. Let men but think over their infinite expenditure of understanding, time, and means on matters and pursuits of far less use and value; whereof, if but a small part were directed to sound and solid studies, there is no difficulty that might not be overcome."</quote><quote id="57" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">Truth therefore and utility are here the very same thing…</quote><quote id="58" author="Francis Bacon" cats="17th century deaths|British politicians|English people|Essayists|Philosophers|Scientists" ref="">Again, we should notice the force, effect, and consequences of inventions, which are nowhere more conspicuous than in those three which were unknown to the ancients; namely, "printing, gunpowder, and the compass."
