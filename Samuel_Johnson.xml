Borne down with years, still doat upon tomorrow!   
That fatal mistress of the young, the lazy,  
The coward, and the fool, condemn'd to lose  
A useless life in waiting for to-morrow,  
To gaze with longing eyes upon to-morrow,  
Till interposing death destroys the prospect  
" Strange! that this general fraud from day to day  
Should fill the world with wretches undetected."  
The soldier, labouring through a winter's march,  
Still sees to-morrow drest in robes of triumph;  
Still to the lover's long-expecting arms  
To-morrow brings the visionary bride.

If a man was to compare the effect of a single stroke of the pick-axe, or of one impression of the spade, with the general design and last result, he would be overwhelmed by the sense of their disproportion; yet those petty operations, incessantly continued, in time surmount the greatest difficulties, and mountains are levelled, and oceans bounded, by the slender force of human beings. 
It is therefore of the utmost importance that those, who have any intention of deviating from the beaten roads of life, and acquiring a reputation superior to names hourly swept away by time among the refuse of fame, should add to their reason, and their spirit, the power of persisting in their purposes; acquire the art of sapping what they cannot batter, and the habit of vanquishing obstinate resistance by obstinate attacks.</quote><quote id="47" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">The student who would build his knowledge on solid foundations, and proceed by just degrees to the pinnacles of truth, is directed by the great philosopher of France to begin by doubting of his own existence. In like manner, whoever would complete any arduous and intricate enterprise, should, as soon as his imagination can cool after the first blaze of hope, place before his own eyes every possible embarrassment that may retard or defeat him. He should first question the probability of success, and then endeavour to remove the objections that he has raised.</quote><quote id="48" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">He that would pass the latter part of life with honour and decency, must, when he is young, consider that he shall one day be old; and remember, when he is old, that he has once been young.</quote><quote id="49" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">Frugality may be termed the daughter of Prudence, the sister of Temperance and the parent of Liberty.</quote><quote id="50" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">"Hope is necessary in every condition." The miseries of poverty, of sickness, or captivity, would, without this comfort, be insupportable; nor does it appear that the happiest lot of terrestrial existence can set us above the want of this general blessing; or that life, when the gifts of nature and of fortune are accumulated upon it, would not still be wretched, were it not elevated and delighted by the expectation of some new possession, of some enjoyment yet behind, by which the wish shall at last be satisfied, and the heart filled up to its utmost extent.</quote><quote id="51" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">"As it is necessary not to invite robbery by supineness, so it is our duty not to suppress tenderness by suspicion; it is better to suffer wrong than to do it, and happier to be sometimes cheated than not to trust."</quote><quote id="52" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">"There are, in every age, new errors to be rectified, and new prejudices to be opposed."</quote><quote id="53" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">"To convince any man against his will is hard, but to please him against his will is justly pronounced by Dryden to be above the reach of human abilities."</quote><quote id="54" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">"In order that all men may be taught to speak truth, it is necessary that all likewise should learn to hear it."</quote><quote id="55" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">"Curiosity is one of the permanent and certain characteristics of a vigorous intellect."</quote><quote id="56" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">"No man is much pleased with a companion, who does not increase, in some respect, his fondness for himself."</quote><quote id="57" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">No place affords a more striking conviction of the vanity of human hopes than a public library.</quote><quote id="58" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">"Almost all absurdity of conduct arises from the imitation of those whom we cannot resemble."</quote><quote id="59" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">No oppression is so heavy or lasting as that which is inflicted by the perversion and exorbitance of legal authority.</quote><quote id="60" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">That he delights in the misery of others no man will confess, and yet what other motive can make a father cruel? </quote><quote id="61" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">The unjustifiable severity of a parent is loaded with this aggravation, that those whom he injures are always in his sight.</quote><quote id="62" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">"Every man is rich or poor according to the proportion between his desires and his enjoyments"; any enlargement of wishes is therefore equally destructive to happiness with the diminution of possession, and he that teaches another to long for what he never shall obtain is no less an enemy to his quiet than if he had robbed him of part of his patrimony.</quote><quote id="63" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">But, perhaps, the excellence of aphorisms consists not so much in the expression of some rare or abstruse sentiment, as in the comprehension of some obvious and useful truth in few words.</quote><quote id="64" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">Every quotation contributes something to the stability or enlargement of the language.</quote><quote id="65" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">I am not so lost in lexicography as to forget that words are the daughters of earth, and that things are the sons of heaven.</quote><quote id="66" author="Samuel Johnson" cats="Authors|Lexicographers" ref="">It is the fate of those, who toil at the lower employments of life, to be rather driven by the fear of evil, than attracted by the prospect of good; to be exposed to censure, without hope of praise; to be disgraced by miscarriage, or punished for neglect, where success would have been without applause, and diligence without reward. "Among these unhappy mortals is the writer of dictionaries, whom mankind have considered, not as the pupil, but the slave of science, the pioneer of literature, doomed only to remove rubbish and clear obstructions from the paths through which Learning and Genius press forward to conquest and glory, without bestowing a smile on the humble drudge that facilitates their progress.

He is no lover of his country, that unnecessarily disturbs its peace." Few errours and few faults of government, can justify an appeal to the rabble; who ought not to judge of what they cannot understand, and whose opinions are not propagated by reason, but caught by contagion.
