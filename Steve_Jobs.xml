This was California. You could get LSD fresh made from Stanford. You could sleep on the beach at night with your girlfriend." California has a sense of experimentation and a sense of openness—openness to new possibilities.</quote><quote id="13" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.</quote><quote id="14" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them.

They don’t know any better.</quote><quote id="20" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">w:John Sculley|John Sculley ruined Apple and he ruined it by bringing a set of values to the top of Apple which were corrupt and corrupted some of the top people who were there, drove out some of the ones who were not corruptible, and brought in more corrupt ones and paid themselves collectively tens of millions of dollars and cared more about their own glory and wealth than they did about what built Apple in the first place — which was making great computers for people to use.</quote><quote id="21" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">We believe it's the biggest advance in animation since Walt Disney started it all with the release of Snow White 50 years ago.</quote><quote id="22" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">If I knew in 1986 how much it was going to cost to keep Pixar going, I doubt if I would have bought the company.</quote><quote id="23" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">You know, I've got a plan that could rescue Apple. I can't say any more than that it's the perfect product and the perfect strategy for Apple. But nobody there will listen to me.</quote><quote id="24" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">The desktop computer industry is dead. Innovation has virtually ceased. Microsoft dominates with very little innovation. That's over. Apple lost. The desktop market has entered the dark ages, and it's going to be in the dark ages for the next 10 years, or certainly for the rest of this decade.</quote><quote id="25" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"When you're young, you look at television and think, There's a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down." But when you get a little older, you realize that's not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That's a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It's the truth.</quote><quote id="26" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Miele&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; really thought the process through.

The PC wars are over. Done. Microsoft won a long time ago.</quote><quote id="28" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">I was worth about over a million dollars when I was twenty-three and over ten million dollars when I was twenty-four, and over a hundred million dollars when I was twenty-five and it wasn't that important because I never did it for the money.</quote><quote id="29" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste. They have absolutely no taste. And I don't mean that in a small way, I mean that in a big way, in the sense that they don't think of original ideas, and they don't bring much culture into their products.</quote><quote id="30" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">I am saddened, not by Microsoft's success — I have no problem with their success. They've earned their success, for the most part.

There's no sex in them anymore!</quote><quote id="34" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Apple has some tremendous assets, but I believe without some attention, the company could, could, could — I'm searching for the right word — could, could die.</quote><quote id="35" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"Nobody has tried to swallow us since I've been here. I think they are afraid how we would taste."</quote><quote id="36" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">iMac is next year's computer for $1,299, not last year's computer for $999.</quote><quote id="37" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"But in the end, for something this complicated, it's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."</quote><quote id="38" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&amp;D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&amp;D. "It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it."</quote><quote id="39" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">I think Pixar has the opportunity to be the next Disney — not replace Disney — but be the next Disney.</quote><quote id="40" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them.</quote><quote id="41" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">You've baked a really lovely cake, but then you've used dog shit for frosting.</quote><quote id="42" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"I would trade all of my technology for an afternoon with Socrates."</quote><quote id="43" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">It will go down in history as a turning point for the music industry. This is landmark stuff. I can't overestimate it!</quote><quote id="44" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">There are sneakers that cost more than an iPod.</quote><quote id="45" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">People think it's this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. "Design is how it works."</quote><quote id="46" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">We don't believe it's possible to protect digital content ... What's new is this amazingly efficient distribution system for stolen property called the Internet — and no one's gonna shut down the Internet. And it only takes one stolen copy to be on the Internet. And the way we expressed it to them is: Pick one lock — open every door. It only takes one person to pick a lock. Worst case: Somebody just takes the analog outputs of their CD player and rerecords it — puts it on the Internet. You'll never stop that. So what you have to do is compete with it. </quote><quote id="47" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">The subscription model of buying music is bankrupt. I think you could make available the Second Coming in a subscription model and it might not be successful.</quote><quote id="48" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"We used to dream about this stuff. Now we get to build it. It's pretty great."</quote><quote id="49" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"We think basically you watch television to turn your brain off, and you work on your computer when you want to turn your brain on."</quote><quote id="50" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Why would I ever want to run Disney? Wouldn't it make more sense just to sell them Pixar and retire?</quote><quote id="51" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">The cure for Apple is not cost-cutting. The cure for Apple is to innovate its way out of its current predicament.</quote><quote id="52" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">It wasn't that Microsoft was so brilliant or clever in copying the Mac, it's that the Mac was a sitting duck for 10 years. That's Apple's problem: Their differentiation evaporated.</quote><quote id="53" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"I'm the only person I know that's lost a quarter of a billion dollars in one year.... It's very character-building."</quote><quote id="54" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">I get asked a lot why Apple's customers are so loyal. It's not because they belong to the Church of Mac! That's ridiculous. </quote><quote id="55" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">I've always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do.</quote><quote id="56" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"The system is that there is no system. That doesn't mean we don't have process. Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes. But that's not what it's about." Process makes you more efficient. 
But innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10:30 at night with a new idea, or because they realized something that shoots holes in how we've been thinking about a problem. It's ad hoc meetings of six people called by someone who thinks he has figured out the coolest new thing ever and who wants to know what other people think of his idea. 
And it comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much. "We're always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it's only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important."</quote><quote id="57" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Mac OS X Tiger will come out long before Longhorn.</quote><quote id="58" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Pixar is the most technically advanced creative company; Apple is the most creatively advanced technical company.</quote><quote id="59" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">They are shamelessly copying us.</quote><quote id="60" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Because I'm the CEO, and I think it can be done.</quote><quote id="61" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Click. Boom. Amazing!</quote><quote id="62" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"And one more thing..."</quote><quote id="63" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's next."</quote><quote id="64" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Our friends up north spend over five billion dollars on research and development and all they seem to do is copy Google and Apple.</quote><quote id="65" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Look at the design of a lot of consumer products — they're really complicated surfaces. We tried to make something much more holistic and simple. When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can often times arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don't put in the time or energy to get there. We believe that customers are smart, and want objects which are well thought through.</quote><quote id="66" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">We had the hardware expertise, the industrial design expertise and the software expertise, including iTunes. One of the biggest insights we have was that we decided not to try to manage your music library on the iPod, but to manage it in iTunes. Other companies tried to do everything on the device itself and made it so complicated that it was useless.</quote><quote id="67" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">I've seen the demonstrations on the Internet about how you can find another person using a Zune and give them a song they can play three times. It takes forever. By the time you've gone through all that, the girl's got up and left! You're much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her ear. Then you're connected with about two feet of headphone cable.</quote><quote id="68" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. It's very fortunate if you can work on just one of these in your career. ... Apple's been very fortunate in that it's introduced a few of these.</quote><quote id="69" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"I make 50 cents for showing up ... and the other 50 cents is based on my performance."</quote><quote id="70" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">I found that there were these incredibly great people at doing certain things, and that you couldn't replace one of these people with 50 average people. They could just do things that no number of average people could do.</quote><quote id="71" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">A lot of companies have chosen to downsize, and maybe that was the right thing for them. We chose a different path. Our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets.</quote><quote id="72" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"I wish developing great products was as easy as writing a check." If that was the case, Microsoft would have great products.</quote><quote id="73" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">It's like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell!</quote><quote id="74" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">We also know first hand that Flash is the number one reason Macs crash.</quote><quote id="75" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">The HD revolution is over, it happened. HD won. Everybody wants HD.</quote><quote id="76" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Sometimes I believe in God, sometimes I don’t. I think it’s 50-50 maybe. But ever since I’ve had cancer, I’ve been thinking about it more. And I find myself believing a bit more. I kind of – maybe it’s ’cause I want to believe in an afterlife. That when you die, it doesn’t just all disappear. The wisdom you’ve accumulated. Somehow it lives on, but sometimes I think it’s just like an on-off switch. Click and you’re gone. And that’s why I don’t like putting on-off switches on Apple devices. </quote><quote id="77" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"If it could save a person’s life, could you find a way to save ten seconds off the boot time?" If there were five million people using the Mac, and it took ten seconds extra to turn it on every day, that added up to three hundred million or so hours per year people would save, which was the equivalent of at least one hundred lifetimes saved per year.</quote><quote id="78" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">You always have to keep pushing to innovate. Dylan could have sung protest songs forever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn’t. He had to move on, and when he did, by going electric in 1965, he alienated a lot of people. His 1966 Europe tour was his greatest…. The Beatles were the same way. "They kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That’s what I’ve always tried to do — keep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, if you are not busy being born, you’re busy dying." </quote><quote id="79" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"OH WOW. OH WOW. OH WOW."</quote><quote id="80" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"Yes, it's tru&lt;sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;e&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;."</quote><quote id="81" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Now, I have something to tell you today. Mac OS X has been leading a secret double life — for the past five years. There have been rumors to this effect... but this is Apple's campus in Cupertino — let's zoom in on it — in that building right there... we've had teams doing the "just-in-case" scenario; and our rules have been that our designs for OS X "must" be processor independent, and that "every" project must be built for "both" the Power PC and Intel processors. And so today for the first time, I can confirm the rumors that every release of OS X has been compiled for both Power PC and Intel — this has been going on for the last five years. Just in case.</quote><quote id="82" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">So Mac OS X is cross-platform "by design," right from the very beginning. So Mac OS X is singing on Intel processors, and I'd just like to show you right now. As a matter of fact... this system I've been using here... Let go have a look... [reveals that the system he had been using for the presentation was running Mac OS X 10.4.1 on a machine using a 3.6 GHz Pentium 4 processor] So.. we've been running on an Intel machine all morning.</quote><quote id="83" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">We intend to release Leopard at the end of 2006 or early 2007, right around the time when Microsoft is expected to release Longhorn.</quote><quote id="84" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, "I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."</quote><quote id="85" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me." The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</quote><quote id="86" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Death is the destination we all share, no one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life.</quote><quote id="87" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life." Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</quote><quote id="88" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life." Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. "Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."</quote><quote id="89" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">No one wants to die. Even people who wanna go to heaven don't wanna die to get there.</quote><quote id="90" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">When I was young, there was an amazing publication called "The Whole Earth Catalog", which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</quote><quote id="91" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to [learn calligraphy]. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful. Historical. Artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture. And I found it fascinating. None of this had any hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would never have multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.</quote><quote id="92" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. "So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."</quote><quote id="93" author="Steve Jobs" cats="2010s deaths|Americans|Businesspeople" ref="">Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and "the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it." And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don’t settle.</quote></quotes>
