Or those should not set forth upon my track
To overtake me, who should miss me here
And long to know if still I held them dear.&lt;p&gt; "They would not find me changed from him they knew — 
Only more sure of all I thought was true."</quote><quote id="1" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"Ah, when to the heart of man

I sha’n’t be gone long. — You come too.</quote><quote id="3" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">And nothing to look backward to with pride,

With anyone to death, comes so far short
They might as well not try to go at all.
No, from the time when one is sick to death,
One is alone, and he dies more alone.
Friends make pretence of following to the grave,
But before one is in it, their minds are turned
And making the best of their way back to life
And living people, and things they understand.</quote><quote id="6" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Most of the change we think we see in life

Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —

That would be good both going and coming back.
"One could do worse than be a swinger of birches."</quote><quote id="16" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">I shall set forth for somewhere,

But I shall be gone.</quote><quote id="17" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Do you know,
Considering the market, there are more
Poems produced than any other thing?
No wonder poets sometimes have to "seem"
So much more businesslike than businessmen.
Their wares are so much harder to get rid of.</quote><quote id="18" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight;
New Hampshire mountains curl up in a coil.</quote><quote id="19" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Nature's first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf's a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.</quote><quote id="20" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">The snake stood up for evil in the Garden.</quote><quote id="21" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Why make so much of fragmentary blue

I think I know enough of hate

Is also great
And would suffice.</quote><quote id="23" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">The way a crow
Shook down on me
The dust of snow
From a hemlock tree&lt;p&gt;Has given my heart
A change of mood
And saved some part
Of a day I had rued.</quote><quote id="24" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">And then we saw him bolt.
We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,

As sweet as I could bear;
And once that seemed too much;
I lived on air</quote><quote id="26" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Now no joy but lacks salt,
That is not dashed with pain
And weariness and fault;
I crave the stain&lt;p&gt;Of tears, the aftermark

The sweet of bitter bark
And burning clove.</quote><quote id="27" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">How often already you've had to be told,
Keep cold, young orchard. Good-bye and keep cold.
Dread fifty above more than fifty below.
I have to be gone for a season or so.</quote><quote id="28" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"It is absurd to think that the only way to tell if a poem is lasting is to wait and see if it lasts.

The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff,
The cliff in being backed by continent;
It looked as if a night of dark intent
Was coming, and not only a night, an age.
Someone had better be prepared for rage.
There would be more than ocean-water broken
Before God's last "Put out the Light" was spoken.</quote><quote id="30" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Tree at my window, window tree,
My sash is lowered when night comes on;
But let there never be curtain drawn

Mine with inner, weather. </quote><quote id="32" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">One luminary clock against the sky
Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
I have been one acquainted with the night.</quote><quote id="33" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">If, as they say, some dust thrown in my eyes
Will keep my talk from getting overwise,
I'm not the one for putting off the proof.
Let it be overwhelming, off a roof
And round a corner, blizzard snow for dust,
And blind me to a standstill if it must.</quote><quote id="34" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Everything written is as good as it is dramatic. It need not declare itself in form, but it is drama or nothing.</quote><quote id="35" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Poetry begins in trivial metaphors, pretty metaphors, "grace" metaphors, and goes on to the profoundest thinking that we have. Poetry provides the one permissible way of saying one thing and meaning another. People say, "Why don’t you say what you mean?" We never do that, do we, being all of us too much poets. We like to talk in parables and in hints and in indirections — whether from diffidence or some other instinct.</quote><quote id="36" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Don’t join too many gangs.

You know how it is with an April day
When the sun is out and the wind is still,
You´re one month on in the middle of May.
But if you so much as dare to speak,
A cloud comes over the sunlit arch,
A wind comes off a frozen peak,
And you´re two months back in the middle of March.</quote><quote id="39" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">But yield who will to their separation,
My object in living is to unite
My avocation and my vocation
As my two eyes make one in sight.
Only where love and need are one,
And the work is play for mortal stakes,
Is the deed ever really done
For heaven and the future´s sakes.</quote><quote id="40" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">No memory of having starred
Atones for later disregard,
Or keeps the end from being hard.&lt;p&gt;Better to go down dignified
With boughten friendship at your side
Than none at all. Provide, provide!</quote><quote id="41" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">The old dog barks backward without getting up;
I can remember when he was a pup.</quote><quote id="42" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"Talking is a hydrant in the yard and writing is a faucet upstairs in the house. Opening the first takes all the pressure off the second." My mouth is sealed for the duration of my stay here. I'm not even going to write letters around to explain to collectors my not having had any Christmas card this year. "I'm not going to explain anything personal any more."</quote><quote id="43" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">When I see young men doing so wonderfully well in athletics, I don’t feel angry at them. I feel jealous of them. I wish that some of my boys in writing would do the same thing. … "You must have form — performance. The thing itself is indescribable, but it is felt like athletic form." To have form, feel form in sports — and by analogy feel form in verse. One works and waits for form in both. As I said, "the person who spends his time criticizing the play around him will never write poetry. He will write criticism — for the "New Republic"."</quote><quote id="44" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">The land was ours before we were the land's. 
She was our land more than a hundred years 
Before we were her people.</quote><quote id="45" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Such as we were we gave ourselves outright

Such as she was, such as she would become. </quote><quote id="46" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">She is as in a field of silken tent 
At midday when the sunny summer breeze

So small the window frames the whole of it.</quote><quote id="110" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">He said twice over before he knew himself: 
"Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?" &lt;p&gt; "Not you!'—'Oh, where's my hat?  Oh, I don't need it! 
I must get out of here.  I must get air.'— 
I don't know rightly whether any man can."  </quote><quote id="111" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">'My words are nearly always an offense. 
I don't know how to speak of anything 
So as to please you.  But I might be taught, 
I should suppose.  I can't say I see how.</quote><quote id="112" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"A man must partly give up being a man 
With womenfolk."  We could have some arrangement 
By which I'd bind myself to keep hands off 
Anything special you're a-mind to name. 
Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that love. 
Two that don't love can't live together without them. 
But two that do can't live together with them." 
She moved the latch a little.  "Don't — don't go. 
Don't carry it to someone else this time. 
Tell me about it if it's something human. 
Let me into your grief.  "I'm not so much 
Unlike other folks as your standing there 
Apart would make me out.  Give me my chance."</quote><quote id="113" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">'I can repeat the very words you were saying: 
"Three foggy mornings and one rainy day 
Will rot the best birch fence a man can build." 
Think of it, talk like that at such a time! 
What had how long it takes a birch to rot 
To do with what was in the darkened parlor? 
You couldn't care!  The nearest friends can go 
With anyone to death, comes so far short 
They might as well not try to go at all.</quote><quote id="114" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village, though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.</quote><quote id="115" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.</quote><quote id="116" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.</quote><quote id="117" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep."</quote><quote id="118" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">Let me be the one  
To do what is done.</quote><quote id="119" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">I turned to speak to God 
About the world's despair 
But to make bad matters worse 
I found God wasn't there. 
God turned to speak to me  
(Don't anybody laugh)  
God found I wasn't there  
At least not over half. </quote><quote id="120" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">And be all plunderers curst.  
'The best way to hate is the worst.  
'Tis to find what the hated need,  
Never mind of what actual worth,  
And wipe that out of the earth.  
Let them die of unsatisfied greed,  
Of unsatisfied love of display,  
Of unsatisfied love of the high,  
Unvulgar, unsoiled, and ideal.  
Let their trappings be taken away.  
Let them suffer starvation and die  
Of being brought down to the real.</quote><quote id="121" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">It should be of the pleasure of a poem itself to tell how it can.

It can never lose its sense of a meaning that once unfolded by surprise as it went.</quote><quote id="124" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"Scholars and artists thrown together are often annoyed at the puzzle of where they differ." Both work from knowledge; but I suspect they differ most importantly in the way their knowledge is come by. Scholars get theirs with conscientious thoroughness along projected lines of logic; poets theirs cavalierly and as it happens in and out of books. "They stick to nothing deliberately, but let what will stick to them like burrs where they walk in the fields."</quote><quote id="125" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"Back out of all this now too much for us,
Back in a time made simple by the loss
Of detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off
Like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,
There is a house that is no more a house
Upon a farm that is no more a farm
And in a town that is no more a town."
The road there, if you'll let a guide direct you
Who only has at heart your getting lost, 
May seem as if it should have been a quarry – 
Great monolithic knees the former town 
Long since gave up pretense of keeping covered. 
And there's a story in a book about it…</quote><quote id="126" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">As for the woods' excitement over you
That sends light rustle rushes to their leaves, 
Charge that to upstart inexperience. &lt;p&gt;Where were they all not twenty years ago? 
"They think too much of having shaded out 
A few old pecker-fretted apple trees."</quote><quote id="127" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"The height of the adventure is the height 
Of country where two village cultures faded 
Into each other. Both of them are lost." &lt;p&gt; And if you're lost enough to find yourself 
By now, pull in your ladder road behind you 
And put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.</quote><quote id="128" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">First there's the children's house of make-believe, 
Some shattered dishes underneath a pine, &lt;Br&gt;The playthings in the playhouse of the children. &lt;p&gt;"Weep for what little things could make them glad."</quote><quote id="129" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"This was no playhouse but a house in earnest. 
Your destination and your destiny's &lt;Br&gt;A brook that was the water of the house, 
Cold as a spring as yet so near its source, 
Too lofty and original to rage." &lt;p&gt; (We know the valley streams that when aroused &lt;Br&gt;Will leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)</quote><quote id="130" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">"I have kept hidden in the instep arch
Of an old cedar at the waterside
A broken drinking goblet like the Grail
Under a spell so the wrong ones can't find it",
So can't get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn't.
(I stole the goblet from the children's playhouse.)
"Here are your waters and your watering place.
Drink and be whole again beyond confusion."</quote><quote id="131" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">{{gutenberg author|id=Robert+Frost|name=Robert Frost}}</quote><quote id="132" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">[http://www.poemhunter.com/robert-lee-frost/poems/ Poems of Robert Frost]</quote><quote id="133" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">[http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rfrost.htm Brief biography] at Kirjasto (Pegasos) </quote><quote id="134" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/frost/frost.htm Frost] at Modern American Poetry</quote><quote id="135" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">[http://www.ketzle.com/frost/ Brief biography &amp; poems]</quote><quote id="136" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">[http://www.americanpoems.com/poets/robertfrost/ Several of Frost's early books online]</quote><quote id="137" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">[http://www.everypoet.com/archive/poetry/Robert_Frost/robert_frost_contents.htm A collection of poetry by Robert Frost]</quote><quote id="138" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">[http://agutie.homestead.com/files/roadnot_1.html The Road Not Taken] (Multi-media presentation)</quote><quote id="139" author="Robert Frost" cats="1960s deaths|American poets|Americans" ref="">[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/frost/biblio.htm Bibliography of Frost's works]</quote></quotes>
