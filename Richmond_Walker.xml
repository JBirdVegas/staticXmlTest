It is only when you and I add the battles of those two awful eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that we break down. It is not the experience of today that drives us mad. It is the remorse or bitterness for something that happened yesterday or the dread of what tomorrow may bring. "Let us therefore do our best to live but one day at a time."</quote><quote id="1" author="Richmond Walker" cats="Americans|Author stubs|Authors" ref="">[http://www.hazelden.org/web/public/ade40517.page|"'Twenty-Four Hours a Day' touches millions in recovery" by Hazelden]</quote></quotes>
