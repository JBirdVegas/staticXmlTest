Give this good reason to yourself for having gone over the mountains, for mankind is ever going over a mountain. Don't suppose that you can tell it precisely the first dozen times you try, but at 'em again, especially when, after a sufficient pause, you suspect that you are touching the heart or summit of the matter, reiterate your blows there, and account for the mountain to yourself.

History tells of Orestes and Pylades, Damon and Pythias, but why should not we put to shame those old reserved worthies by a community of such? Constantly, as it were through a remote skylight, I have glimpses of a serene friendship-land, and know the better why brooks murmur and violets grow. This conjunction of souls, like waves which met and break, subsides also backward over things, and gives all a fresh aspect. I would live henceforth with some gentle soul such a life as may be conceived, double for variety, single for harmony — two, only that we might admire at our oneness — one, because indivisible. Such community to be a pledge of holy living. How could aught unworthy be admitted into our society? To listen with one ear to each summer sound, to behold with one eye each summer scene, our visual rays so to meet and mingle with the object as to be one bent and doubled; with two tongues to be wearied, and thought to spring ceaselessly from a double fountain.</quote><quote id="22" author="Henry David Thoreau" cats="1860s deaths|Abolitionists|American poets|Anarchists|Authors|Diarists|Environmentalists|Essayists|Naturalists|Philosophers" ref="">"Poetry — No definition of poetry is adequate unless it be poetry itself." The most accurate analysis by the rarest wisdom is yet insufficient, and the poet will instantly prove it false by setting aside its requisitions. It is indeed all that we do not know. The poet does not need to see how meadows are something else than earth, grass, and water, but how they are thus much. He does not need discover that potato blows are as beautiful as violets, as the farmer thinks, but only how good potato blows are. The poem is drawn out from under the feet of the poet, his whole weight has rested on this ground. It has a logic more severe than the logician's. "You might as well think to go in pursuit of the rainbow, and embrace it on the next hill, as to embrace the whole of poetry even in thought."</quote><quote id="23" author="Henry David Thoreau" cats="1860s deaths|Abolitionists|American poets|Anarchists|Authors|Diarists|Environmentalists|Essayists|Naturalists|Philosophers" ref="">"Aeschylus had a clear eye for the commonest things. His genius was only an enlarged common sense." He adverts with chaste severity to all natural facts. His sublimity is Greek sincerity and simpleness, naked wonder which mythology had not helped to explain... Whatever the common eye sees at all and expresses as best it may, he sees uncommonly and describes with rare completeness. The multitude that thronged the theatre could no doubt go along with him to the end... The social condition of genius is the same in all ages. Aeschylus was undoubtedly alone and without sympathy in his simple reverence for the mystery of the universe.</quote><quote id="24" author="Henry David Thoreau" cats="1860s deaths|Abolitionists|American poets|Anarchists|Authors|Diarists|Environmentalists|Essayists|Naturalists|Philosophers" ref="">An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day.</quote><quote id="25" author="Henry David Thoreau" cats="1860s deaths|Abolitionists|American poets|Anarchists|Authors|Diarists|Environmentalists|Essayists|Naturalists|Philosophers" ref="">"Have no mean hours, but be grateful for every hour, and accept what it brings. The reality will make any sincere record respectable." No day will have been wholly misspent, if one sincere, thoughtful page has been written. Let the daily tide leave some deposit on these pages, as it leaves sand and shells on the shore. So much increase of terra firma. this may be a calendar of the ebbs and flows of the soul; and on these sheets as a beach, the waves may cast up pearls and seaweed.</quote><quote id="26" author="Henry David Thoreau" cats="1860s deaths|Abolitionists|American poets|Anarchists|Authors|Diarists|Environmentalists|Essayists|Naturalists|Philosophers" ref="">"Who looks in the sun will see no light else; but also he will see no shadow.

Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe — "That government is best which governs not at all"; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."</quote><quote id="59" author="Henry David Thoreau" cats="1860s deaths|Abolitionists|American poets|Anarchists|Authors|Diarists|Environmentalists|Essayists|Naturalists|Philosophers" ref="">"To speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government. Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect, and that will be one step toward obtaining it." After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule, is not because they are most likely to be in the right, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice, even as far as men understand it. Can there not be a government in which majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience? — in which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable? "Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience, then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right." It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience. "Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice."</quote><quote id="60" author="Henry David Thoreau" cats="1860s deaths|Abolitionists|American poets|Anarchists|Authors|Diarists|Environmentalists|Essayists|Naturalists|Philosophers" ref="">How does it become a man to behave toward this American government today?

What makes this duty the more urgent is the fact that the country so overrun is not our own, but ours is the invading army."</quote><quote id="62" author="Henry David Thoreau" cats="1860s deaths|Abolitionists|American poets|Anarchists|Authors|Diarists|Environmentalists|Essayists|Naturalists|Philosophers" ref="">All voting is a sort of gaming, like checkers or backgammon, with a slight moral tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moral questions; and betting naturally accompanies it.  The character of the voters is not staked.  I cast my vote, perchance, as I think right; but I am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail.  I am willing to leave it to the majority.  Its obligation, therefore, never exceeds that of expediency.  Even voting for the right is doing nothing for it.  It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail.  "A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority. There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men." When the majority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery, it will be because they are indifferent to slavery, or because there is but little slavery left to be abolished by their vote. They will then be the only slaves.
