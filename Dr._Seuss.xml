Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living." It's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope, which is what I do, and that enables you to laugh at life's realities.</quote><quote id="6" author="Dr. Seuss" cats="1990s deaths|American authors|Children's authors|Jews" ref="">"Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple."</quote><quote id="7" author="Dr. Seuss" cats="1990s deaths|American authors|Children's authors|Jews" ref="">And that is a story that no one can beat,

Which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please; 
But I also speak for the brown Barbaloots, 
Who frolicked and played in their Barbaloot suits, 
Happily eating Truffula fruits. 
Now, since you've chopped the trees to the ground 
There's not enough Truffula fruit to go 'round! 
And my poor Barbaloots are all feeling the crummies 
Because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies.</quote><quote id="31" author="Dr. Seuss" cats="1990s deaths|American authors|Children's authors|Jews" ref="">"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,

He lets something fall. 
It's a Truffula Seed. 
It's the last one of all! 
You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds. 
And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs. 
Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care. 
Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air. 
Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack. 
Then the Lorax 
and all of his friends 
may come back.</quote><quote id="33" author="Dr. Seuss" cats="1990s deaths|American authors|Children's authors|Jews" ref="">Now all that was left 'neath the bad-smelling sky 
was my big empty factory... 
the Lorax... 
and I. 
The Lorax said nothing 
just gave me a glance.
Just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance. 
He lifted himself by the seat of his pants 
and I'll never forget the grim look on his face 
 as he hoisted himself and took leave of this place 
through a hole in the smog without leaving a trace 
and all that the Lorax left here in this mess was a small pile of rocks with one word. 
"UNLESS"</quote><quote id="34" author="Dr. Seuss" cats="1990s deaths|American authors|Children's authors|Jews" ref="">And suppose that you lived

To people as brainy and footsy as you. 
And when things start to happen, don't worry, don't stew. 
Just go right along, you'll start happening too!</quote><quote id="42" author="Dr. Seuss" cats="1990s deaths|American authors|Children's authors|Jews" ref="">Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.</quote></quotes>
