Is there not some more valuable work to be done in his specialty? That's what I hear many of my colleagues ask, and I sense it from many more. But I cannot share this sentiment. When I think about the ablest students whom I have encountered in my teaching — that is, those who distinguish themselves by their independence of judgment and not just their quick-wittedness — I can affirm that they had a vigorous interest in epistemology. They happily began discussions about the goals and methods of science, and they showed unequivocally, through tenacious defense of their views, that the subject seemed important to them.
"Concepts that have proven useful in ordering things easily achieve such authority over us that we forget their earthly origins and accept them as unalterable givens." ["Begriffe, welche sich bei der Ordnung der Dinge als nützlich erwiesen haben, erlangen über uns leicht eine solche Autorität, dass wir ihres irdischen Ursprungs vergessen und sie als unabänderliche Gegebenheiten hinnehmen."] Thus they might come to be stamped as "necessities of thought," "a priori givens," etc. The path of scientific progress is often made impassable for a long time by such errors. ["Der Weg des wissenschaftlichen Fortschritts wird durch solche Irrtümer oft für längere Zeit ungangbar gemacht".] "Therefore it is by no means an idle game if we become practiced in analysing long-held commonplace concepts and showing the circumstances on which their justification and usefulness depend, and how they have grown up, individually, out of the givens of experience. Thus their excessive authority will be broken." They will be removed if they cannot be properly legitimated, corrected if their correlation with given things be far too superfluous, or replaced if a new system can be established that we prefer for whatever reason.</quote><quote id="9" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">Our entire much-praised technological progress, and civilization generally, could be compared to an axe in the hand of a pathological criminal.</quote><quote id="10" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"I am by heritage a Jew, by citizenship a Swiss, and by makeup a human being, and "only" a human being, without any special attachment to any state or national entity whatsoever."</quote><quote id="11" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">I have also considered many scientific plans during my pushing you around in your pram!</quote><quote id="12" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">Make a lot of walks to get healthy and don’t read that much but save yourself some until you’re grown up.</quote><quote id="13" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">Dear mother!

Why then should it not be the right thing for the physicist to let the philosopher do the philosophizing? Such might indeed be the right thing to do a time when the physicist believes he has at his disposal a rigid system of fundamental laws which are so well established that waves of doubt can't reach them; but it cannot be right at a time when the very foundations of physics itself have become problematic as they are now. At a time like the present, when experience forces us to seek a newer and more solid foundation, the physicist cannot simply surrender to the philosopher the critical contemplation of theoretical foundations; for he himself knows best and feels more surely where the shoe pinches. In looking for an new foundation, he must try to make clear in his own mind just how far the concepts which he uses are justified, and are necessities.</quote><quote id="50" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"One may say "the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.""</quote><quote id="51" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree.

They seek to fulfill this great task by spreading moral and cultural understanding, renouncing the use of brute force.

We are ... all aware of the situation regarding what will turn out to be the basic foundational concepts in physics: the point-mass or the particle is surely not among them; the field, in the Faraday-Maxwell sense, might be, but not with certainty. But that which we conceive as existing ("real") should somehow be localized in time and space. That is, the real in one part of space, "A", should (in theory) somehow "exist" independently of that which is thought of as real in another part of space, "B". If a physical system stretches over "A" and "B", then what is present in "B" should somehow have an existence independent of what is present in "A". What is actually present in "B" should thus not depend the type of measurement carried out in the part of space "A"; it should also be independent of whether or not a measurement is made in "A". 
If one adheres to this program, then one can hardly view the quantum-theoretical description as a complete representation of the physically real. If one attempts, nevertheless, so to view it, then one must assume that the physically real in "B" undergoes a sudden change because of a measurement in "A". My physical instincts bristle at that suggestion. 
However, if one renounces the assumption that what is present in different parts of space has an independent, real existence, then I don't see at all what physics is supposed to be describing. For "what is thought to be a "system" is after all, just conventional, and I do not see how one is supposed to divide up the world objectively so that one can make statements about parts."</quote><quote id="81" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"Never do anything against conscience even if the state demands it."</quote><quote id="82" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">Since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity, I do not understand it myself anymore.</quote><quote id="83" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"I do not know how the Third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth — rocks!"</quote><quote id="84" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"A new idea comes suddenly and in a rather intuitive way.

They are dependent on each other. Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is — insofar as it is thinkable at all — primitive and muddled. However, no sooner has the epistemologist, who is seeking a clear system, fought his way through to such a system, than he is inclined to interpret the thought-content of science in the sense of his system and to reject whatever does not fit into his system. The scientist, however, cannot afford to carry his striving for epistemological systematic that far. He accepts gratefully the epistemological conceptual analysis; but the external conditions, which are set for him by the facts of experience, do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted in the construction of his conceptual world by the adherence to an epistemological system. He therefore must appear to the systematic epistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist: he appears as "realist" insofar as he seeks to describe a world independent of the acts of perception; as "idealist" insofar as he looks upon the concepts and theories as free inventions of the human spirit (not logically derivable from what is empirically given); as "positivist" insofar as he considers his concepts and theories justified "only" to the extent to which they furnish a logical representation of relations among sensory experiences.

That is to say, the hypotheses from which one starts become ever more abstract and more remote from experience. But in return one comes closer to the preeminent goal of science, that of encompassing a maximum of empirical contents through logical deduction with a minimum of hypotheses or axioms. The intellectual path from the axioms to the empirical contents or to the testable consequences becomes, thereby, ever longer and more subtle. "The theoretician is forced, ever more, to allow himself to be directed by purely mathematical, formal points of view in the search for theories, because the physical experience of the experimenter is not capable of leading us up to the regions of the highest abstraction." Tentative deduction takes the place of the predominantly inductive methods appropriate to the youthful state of science. Such a theoretical structure must be quite thoroughly elaborated in order for it to lead to consequences that can be compared with experience. It is certainly the case that here, as well, the empirical fact is the all-powerful judge. But its judgment can be handed down only on the basis of great and difficult intellectual effort that first bridges the wide space between the axioms and the testable consequences. The theorist must accomplish this Herculean task with the clear understanding that this effort may only be destined to prepare the way for a death sentence for his theory. "One should not reproach the theorist who undertakes such a task by calling him a fantast; instead, one must allow him his fantasizing, since for him there is no other way to his goal whatsoever. Indeed, it is no planless fantasizing, but rather a search for the logically simplest possibilities and their consequences."</quote><quote id="109" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me.

Many take to science out of a joyful sense of superior intellectual power; science is their own special sport to which they look for vivid experience and the satisfaction of ambition; many others are to be found in the temple who have offered the products of their brains on this altar for purely utilitarian purposes. "Were an angel of the Lord to come and drive all the people belonging to these two categories out of the temple, the assemblage would be seriously depleted, but there would still be some men, of both present and past times, left inside. Our Planck is one of them, and that is why we love him."
I am quite aware that we have just now lightheartedly expelled in imagination many excellent men who are largely, perhaps chiefly, responsible for the buildings of the temple of science; and in many cases our angel would find it a pretty ticklish job to decide. But of one thing I feel sure: if the types we have just expelled were the only types there were, the temple would never have come to be, any more than a forest can grow which consists of nothing but creepers. For these people any sphere of human activity will do, if it comes to a point; whether they become engineers, officers, tradesmen, or scientists depends on circumstances.
Now let us have another look at those who have found favor with the angel.

"An important advance in the life of a people is the transformation of the religion of fear into the moral religion. But one must avoid the prejudice that regards the religions of primitive peoples as pure fear religions and those of the civilized races as pure moral religions. All are mixed forms, though the moral element predominates in the higher levels of social life."</quote><quote id="184" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of the idea of God. Only exceptionally gifted individuals or especially noble communities rise "essentially" above this level; in these there is found a third level of religious experience, even if it is seldom found in a pure form. I will call it the cosmic religious sense. "This is hard to make clear to those who do not experience it, since it does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of God; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought." He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance. Indications of this cosmic religious sense can be found even on earlier levels of development—for example, in the Psalms of David and in the Prophets. The cosmic element is much stronger in Buddhism, as, in particular, Schopenhauer's magnificent essays have shown us. "The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor God made in man's image. Consequently there cannot be a church whose chief doctrines are based on the cosmic religious experience. It comes about, therefore, that we find precisely among the heretics of all ages men who were inspired by this highest religious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints.

Neither the religion of fear nor the social-moral religion can have any hold on him. A God who rewards and punishes is for him unthinkable, because man acts in accordance with an inner and outer necessity, and would, in the eyes of God, be as little responsible as an inanimate object is for the movements which it makes. "Science, in consequence, has been accused of undermining morals—but wrongly. The ethical behavior of man is better based on sympathy, education and social relationships, and requires no support from religion. Man's plight would, indeed, be sad if he had to be kept in order through fear of punishment and hope of rewards after death."</quote><quote id="187" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">It is, therefore, quite natural that the churches have always fought against science and have persecuted its supporters. But, on the other hand, "I assert that the cosmic religious experience is the strongest and noblest driving force behind scientific research." No one who does not appreciate the terrific exertions, and, above all, the devotion without which pioneer creations in scientific thought cannot come into being, can judge the strength of the feeling out of which alone such work, turned away as it is from immediate practical life, can grow. What a "deep faith in the rationality of the structure of the world" and what a longing to understand even a small glimpse of the reason revealed in the world there must have been in Kepler and Newton to enable them to unravel the mechanism of the heavens in long years of lonely work! "Any one who only knows scientific research in its practical applications may easily come to a wrong interpretation of the state of mind of the men who, surrounded by skeptical contemporaries, have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered over all countries in all centuries." Only those who have dedicated their lives to similar ends can have a living conception of the inspiration which gave these men the power to remain loyal to their purpose in spite of countless failures. It is the cosmic religious sense which grants this power.

Science is the century-old endeavor to bring together by means of systematic thought the perceptible phenomena of this world into as thoroughgoing an association as possible."

It seems to me that what is important is the force of this superpersonal content and the depth of the conviction concerning its overpowering meaningfulness, regardless of whether any attempt is made to unite this content with a divine Being, for otherwise it would not be possible to count Buddha and Spinoza as religious personalities. "Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance and loftiness of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation. They exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as he himself." In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary.</quote><quote id="211" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">A conflict arises when a religious community insists on the absolute truthfulness of all statements recorded in the Bible. This means an intervention on the part of religion into the sphere of science; this is where the struggle of the Church against the doctrines of Galileo and Darwin belongs.

These conflicts have all sprung from fatal errors.</quote><quote id="212" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"Even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies." Though religion may be that which determines the goal, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up. But "science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion. To this there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational, that is, comprehensible to reason. I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith." The situation may be expressed by an image: "science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."
Though I have asserted above that in truth a legitimate conflict between religion and science cannot exist, I must nevertheless qualify this assertion once again on an essential point, with reference to the actual content of historical religions. This qualification has to do with the concept of God. During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution human fantasy created gods in man's own image, who, by the operations of their will were supposed to determine, or at any rate to influence, the phenomenal world. Man sought to alter the disposition of these gods in his own favor by means of magic and prayer. The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old concept of the gods. Its anthropomorphic character is shown, for instance, by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead for the fulfillment of their wishes. </quote><quote id="213" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"Nobody, certainly, will deny that the idea of the existence of an omnipotent, just, and omnibeneficent personal God is able to accord man solace, help, and guidance; also, by virtue of its simplicity it is accessible to the most undeveloped mind. But, on the other hand, there are decisive weaknesses attached to this idea in itself, which have been painfully felt since the beginning of history." That is, if this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him?
"The main source of the present-day conflicts between the spheres of religion and of science lies in this concept of a personal God."</quote><quote id="214" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">When the number of factors coming into play in a phenomenological complex is too large, scientific method in most cases fails us. One need only think of the weather, in which case prediction even for a few days ahead is impossible. Nevertheless no one doubts that we are confronted with a causal connection whose causal components are in the main known to us.
Occurrences in this domain are beyond the reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation, not because of any lack of order in nature.</quote><quote id="215" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.
But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. For a doctrine which is able to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself. This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task.</quote><quote id="216" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">If it is one of the goals of religion to liberate mankind as far as possible from the bondage of egocentric cravings, desires, and fears, scientific reasoning can aid religion in yet another sense. Although it is true that it is the goal of science to discover rules which permit the association and foretelling of facts, this is not its only aim. It also seeks to reduce the connections discovered to the smallest possible number of mutually independent conceptual elements.
It is in this striving after the rational unification of the manifold that it encounters its greatest successes, even though it is precisely this attempt which causes it to run the greatest risk of falling a prey to illusions. "But whoever has undergone the intense experience of successful advances made in this domain is moved by profound reverence for the rationality made manifest in existence." By way of the understanding he achieves a far-reaching emancipation from the shackles of personal hopes and desires, and thereby attains that humble attitude of mind toward the grandeur of reason incarnate in existence, and which, in its profoundest depths, is inaccessible to man.
This attitude, however, appears to me to be religious, in the highest sense of the word. And so it seems to me that "science not only purifies the religious impulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism but also contributes to a religious spiritualization of our understanding of life."
The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge."</quote><quote id="217" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"Many persons have inquired concerning a recent message of mine that "a new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move to higher levels.""

While it is true that science, to the extent of its grasp of causative connections, may reach important conclusions as to the compatibility and incompatibility of goals and evaluations, the independent and fundamental definitions regarding goals and values remain beyond science's reach.
As regards religion, on the other hand, one is generally agreed that it deals with goals and evaluations and, in general, with the emotional foundation of human thinking and acting, as far as these are not predetermined by the inalterable hereditary disposition of the human species. "Religion is concerned with man's attitude toward nature at large, with the establishing of ideals for the individual and communal life, and with mutual human relationship." These ideals religion attempts to attain by exerting an educational influence on tradition and through the development and promulgation of certain easily accessible thoughts and narratives (epics and myths) which are apt to influence evaluation and action along the lines of the accepted ideals.</quote><quote id="221" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">It is this mythical, or rather this symbolic, content of the religious traditions which is likely to come into conflict with science.

"There are pessimists who hold that such a state of affairs is necessarily inherent in human nature; it is those who propound such views that are the enemies of true religion, for they imply thereby that religious teachings are Utopian ideals and unsuited to afford guidance in human affairs."

By the mere existence of his stomach everyone was condemned to participate in that chase. Moreover, it was possible to satisfy the stomach by such participation, but not man in so far as he is a thinking and feeling being. As the first way out there was religion, which is implanted into every child by way of the traditional education-machine. "Thus I came—despite the fact that I was the son of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents—to a deep religiosity, which, however, found an abrupt ending at the age of 12." Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic [orgy of] freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression.

The contemplation of this world beckoned like a liberation, and I soon noticed that many a man whom I had learned to esteem and to admire had found inner freedom and security in devoted occupation with it. The mental grasp of this extrapersonal world within the frame of the given possibilites swam as highest aim half consciously and half unconsciously before my mind's eye. Similarly motivated men of the present and of the past, as well as the insights which they had achieved, were the friends which could not be lost.

For how, otherwise, should it happen that sometimes we "wonder" quite spontaneously about some experience? This "wondering" seems to occur when an experience comes into conflict with a world of concepts which is already sufficiently fixed in us. Whenever such a conflict is experienced hard and intensively it reacts back upon our thought world in a decisive way. The development of this thought world is in a certain sense a continuous flight from "wonder."pp. 341-342 of "A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion"</quote><quote id="229" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"A wonder of such nature I experienced as a child of 4 or 5 years, when my father showed me a compass."

I can still remember—or at least believe I can remember—that this experience made a deep and lasting impression upon me. Something deeply hidden had to be behind things. What man sees before him from infancy causes no reaction of this kind; he is not surprised over the falling of bodies, concerning wind and rain, nor concerning the moon or about the fact that the moon does not fall down, nor concerning the differences between living and non-living matter.
At the age of 12 I experienced a second wonder of a totally different nature: in a little book dealing with Euclidean plane geometry, which came into my hands at the beginning of a schoolyear. Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point, which—though by no means evident—could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question.

By and by I despaired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and the more despairingly I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results. . . . How, then, could such a universal principle be found? "After ten years of reflection such a principle resulted from a paradox upon which I had already hit at the age of sixteen: If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity "c" (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic field at rest. However, there seems to be no such thing, whether on the bases of experience or according to Maxwell's equations." From the very beginning it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the stand-point of such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest.362-363 of "A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion"</quote><quote id="234" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"What is the meaning of human life, or of organic life altogether?

The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been communicated to us by other people through the medium of a language which others have created. Without language our mental capacities would be poor indeed, comparable to those of the higher animals; we have, therefore, to admit that we owe our principal advantage over the beasts to the fact of living in human society. "The individual, if left alone from birth would remain primitive and beast-like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardly conceive.

"And yet such an attitude would be wrong." It is clear that all the valuable things, material, spiritual, and moral, which we receive from society can be traced back through countless generations to certain creative individuals. The use of fire, the cultivation of edible plants, the steam engine — each was discovered by one man.
"Only the individual can think, and thereby create new values for society — nay, even set up new moral standards to which the life of the community conforms. Without creative, independently thinking and judging personalities the upward development of society is as unthinkable as the development of the individual personality without the nourishing soil of the community.
The health of society thus depends quite as much on the independence of the individuals composing it as on their close political cohesion."</quote><quote id="238" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">I am absolutely convinced that no wealth in the world can help humanity forward, even in the hands of the most devoted worker in this cause.

But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation. The future, to him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past. There is nothing divine about morality, it is a purely human affair. His religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection."

In so far as the labor contract is free what the worker receives is determined not by the real value of the goods he produces, but by his minimum needs and by the capitalists' requirements for labor power in relation to the number of workers competing for jobs.

Thus already our precarious situation forces us to stand together irrespective of our citizenship.

At the least, he is to feel pity for the adherent of another religion but usually it does not stop there. The faithful adherent of a religion will try first of all to convince those that believe in another religion and usually he goes on to hatred if he is not successful. However, hatred then leads to persecution when the might of the majority is behind it.
In the case of a Christian clergyman, the tragic-comical is found in this: that the Christian religion demands love from the faithful, even love for the enemy. This demand, because it is indeed superhuman, he is unable to fulfill. Thus intolerance and hatred ring through the oily words of the clergyman. The love, which on the Christian side is the basis for the conciliatory attempt towards Judaism is the same as the love of a child for a cake. That means that it contains the hope that the object of the love will be eaten up...</quote><quote id="347" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">If I would follow your advice and Jesus could perceive it, he, as a Jewish teacher, surely would not approve of such behavior.</quote><quote id="348" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"The fact that man produces a concept "I" besides the totality of his mental and emotional experiences or perceptions does not prove that there must be any specific existence behind such a concept. We are succumbing to illusions produced by our self-created language, without reaching a better understanding of anything."

It is a different question whether belief in a personal God should be contested. Freud endorsed this view in his latest publication. I myself would never engage in such a task. For such a belief seems to me preferable to the lack of any transcendental outlook of life, and I wonder whether one can ever successfully render to the majority of mankind a more sublime means in order to satisfy its metaphysical needs.</quote><quote id="352" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">Speaking of the spirit that informs modern scientific investigations, I am of the opinion that all the finer speculations in the realm of science spring from a deep religious feeling, and that without such a feeling they would not be fruitful. "I also believe that, this kind of religiousness, which makes itself felt today in scientific investigations, is the only creative religious activity of our time." The art of today can hardly be looked upon at all as expressive of our religious instincts.</quote><quote id="353" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">Scientific research is based on the assumption that all events, including the actions of mankind, are determined by the laws of nature. Therefore, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, that is, by a wish addressed to a supernatural Being. However, we have to admit that our actual knowledge of these laws is only an incomplete piece of work (unvollkommenes Stückwerk), so that ultimately the belief in the existence of fundamental all-embracing laws also rests on a sort of faith. All the same, this faith has been largely justified by the success of science. On the other hand, however, "every one who is seriously engaged in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that the laws of nature manifest the existence of a spirit vastly superior to that of men, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble." The pursuit of science leads therefore to a religious feeling of a special kind, which differs essentially from the religiosity of more naive people.</quote><quote id="354" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">I was barked at by numerous dogs who are earning their food guarding ignorance and superstition for the benefit of those who profit from it. Then there are the fanatical atheists whose intolerance is of the same kind as the intolerance of the religious fanatics and comes from the same source. They are like slaves who are still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off after hard struggle. They are creatures who—in their grudge against the traditional "opium for the people"—cannot bear the music of the spheres. "The Wonder of nature does not become smaller because one cannot measure it by the standards of human moral and human aims."</quote><quote id="355" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">I have found no better expression than "religious" for confidence in the rational nature of reality as it is accessible to human reason. Wherever this feeling is absent, science degenerates into uninspired empiricism. ... I cannot accept your opinion concerning science and ethics or the determination of aims. What we call science has the sole purpose of determining what "is". The determining of what "ought to be" is unrelated to it and cannot be accomplished methodically. "Science can only arrange ethical propositions logically and furnish the means for the realization of ethical aims, but the determination of aims is beyond its scope." At least that is the way I see it.</quote><quote id="356" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">The idea of a personal God is quite alien to me and seems even naive. However, I am also not a "Freethinker" in the usual sense of the word because I find that this is in the main an attitude nourished exclusively by an opposition against naive superstition. My feeling is insofar religious as I am imbued with the consciousness of the insufficiency of the human mind to understand deeply the harmony of the Universe which we try to formulate as "laws of nature." It is this consciousness and humility I miss in the Free-thinker mentality.</quote><quote id="357" author="Albert Einstein" cats="1950s deaths|Americans|Cosmologists|Germans|Jews|Mathematicians|Nobel Prize winners|Pacifists|Physicists|Refugees" ref="">"I want to know how God created this world.

I feel also not able to imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere. My views are near to those of Spinoza: admiration for the beauty of and belief in the logical simplicity of the order and harmony which we can grasp humbly and only imperfectly. "I believe that we have to content ourselves with our imperfect knowledge and understanding and treat values and moral obligations as a purely human problem—the most important of all human problems."</quote></quotes>
