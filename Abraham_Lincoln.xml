That every man may receive at least a moderate education, and thereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries, by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions, appears to be an object of vital importance, even on this account alone, to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the Scriptures, and other works both of a religious and moral nature, for themselves.</quote><quote id="1" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition.

This is a most valuable, a most sacred right — a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can may revolutionize and make their own of so much of the territory as they inhabit.</quote><quote id="9" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so, whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose, and you allow him to make war at pleasure." Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect, after having given him so much as you propose. If, to-day, he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, "I see no probability of the British invading us" but he will say to you, "Be silent; I see it, if you don't."
"The provision of the Constitution giving the war making power to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons. Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us." But your view destroys the whole matter, and places our President where kings have always stood.</quote><quote id="10" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">In law it is a good policy never to plead what you need not, lest you oblige yourself to prove what you cannot.</quote><quote id="11" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"The true rule, in determining to embrace, or reject any thing, is not whether it have any evil in it; but whether it have more of evil, than of good." There are few things wholly evil, or wholly good. Almost every thing, especially of governmental policy, is an inseparable compound of the two; so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually demanded.</quote><quote id="12" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Determine that the thing can and shall be done, and then we shall find the way."</quote><quote id="13" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">The way for a young man to rise, is to improve himself every way he can, never suspecting that any body wishes to hinder him.</quote><quote id="14" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"The better part of one's life consists of his friendships."</quote><quote id="15" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"The legitimate object of government, is to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but can not do, "at all", or can not, "so well do", for themselves - in their separate, and individual capacities. In all that the people can individually do as well for themselves, government ought not to interfere." The desirable things which the individuals of a people can not do, or can not well do, for themselves, fall into two classes: those which have relation to "wrongs", and those which have not. Each of these branch off into an infinite variety of subdivisions. The first - that in relation to wrongs - embraces all crimes, misdemeanors, and nonperformance of contracts. The other embraces all which, in its nature, and without wrong, requires combined action, as public roads and highways, public schools, charities, pauperism, orphanage, estates of the deceased, and the machinery of government itself. From this it appears that if all men were just, there still would be "some", though not" so much", need for government.</quote><quote id="16" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser — in fees, expenses, and waste of time." As a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be business enough.
Never stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found than one who does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually overhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles, whereon to stir up strife, and put money in his pocket? A moral tone ought to be infused into the profession which should drive such men out of it.</quote><quote id="17" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">There is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest. I say vague, because when we consider to what extent confidence and honors are reposed in and conferred upon lawyers by the people, it appears improbable that their impression of dishonesty is very distinct and vivid. Yet the impression is common, almost universal. Let no young man choosing the law for a calling for a moment yield to the popular belief — "resolve to be honest at all events; and if in your own judgment you cannot be an honest lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a lawyer." Choose some other occupation, rather than one in the choosing of which you do, in advance, consent to be a knave.</quote><quote id="18" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">The Autocrat of all the Russias will resign his crown, and proclaim his subjects free republicans sooner than will our American masters voluntarily give up their slaves.</quote><quote id="19" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"You enquire where I now stand. That is a disputed point." I think I am a whig; but others say there are no whigs, and that I am an abolitionist. When I was at Washington I voted for the Wilmot Proviso as good as forty times, and I never heard of any one attempting to unwhig me for that. I now do more than oppose the "extension" of slavery.
I am not a Know-Nothing. That is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. "As a nation, we began by declaring that" "all men are created equal." "We now practically read it "all men are created equal, "except negroes."" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read "all men are created equal, except negroes, "and foreigners, and catholics."" When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty — to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be take pure, and without the base alloy of hypocracy" [sic].</quote><quote id="20" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">If you are resolutely determined to make a lawyer of yourself, the thing is more than half done already. It is but a small matter whether you read "with" anyone or not. I did not read with anyone. Get the books, and read and study them till you understand them in their principal features; and that is the main thing. It is of no consequence to be in a large town while you are reading. I read at New Salem, which never had three hundred people living in it. The "books", and your "capacity" for understanding them, are just the same in all places....

It is not our frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, the guns of our war steamers, or the strength our gallant and disciplined army? These are not our reliance against a resumption of tyranny in our fair land. All of those may be turned against our liberties, without making us weaker or stronger for the struggle. Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in our bosoms. "Our defense is in the preservation of the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands, everywhere. Destroy this spirit, and you have planted the seeds of despotism around your own doors. Familiarize yourselves with the chains of bondage and you are preparing your own limbs to wear them. Accustomed to trample on the rights of those around you, you have lost the genius of your own independence, and become the fit subjects of the first cunning tyrant who rises."</quote><quote id="27" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man, this race and that race and the other race being inferior and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position.

How little they "know", whereof they "speak"! There is no permanent class of hired laborers amongst us. Twentyfive years ago, I was a hired laborer. The hired laborer of yesterday, labors on his own account to-day; and will hire others to labor for him to-morrow. "Advancement---improvement in condition---is the order of things in a society of equals. As Labor is the common "burthen" of our race, so the effort of "some" to shift their share of the burthen on to the shoulders of "others", is the great, durable, curse of the race. Originally a curse for transgression upon the whole race, when, as by slavery, it is concentrated on a part only, it becomes the double-refined curse of God upon his creatures."</quote><quote id="32" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Free labor has the inspiration of hope; pure slavery has no hope. The power of hope upon human exertion, and happiness, is wonderful." The slave-master himself has a conception of it; and hence the system of "tasks" among slaves. The slave whom you can not drive with the lash to break seventy-five pounds of hemp in a day, if you will task him to break a hundred, and promise him pay for all he does over, he will break you a hundred and fifty. You have substituted "hope", for the "rod". And yet perhaps it does not occur to you, that to the extent of your gain in the case, you have given up the slave system, and adopted the free system of labor.</quote><quote id="33" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">I say that we must not interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists, because the Constitution forbids it, and the general welfare does not require us to do so. We must not withhold an efficient Fugitive Slave law, because the Constitution requires us, as I understand it, not to withhold such a law. But we must prevent the outspreading of the institution, because neither the Constitution nor general welfare requires us to extend it. We must prevent the revival of the African slave trade, and the enacting by Congress of a Territorial slave code. We must prevent each of these things being done by either Congresses or courts. "The people of these United States are the rightful masters of both Congresses and courts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution."</quote><quote id="34" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">I think very much of the people, as an old friend said he thought of woman. He said when he lost his first wife, who had been a great help to him in his business, he thought he was ruined—that he could never find another to fill her place. At length, however, he married another, who he found did quite as well as the first, and that his opinion now was that any woman would do well who was well done by. So I think of the whole people of this nation—they will ever do well if well done by. We will try to do well by them in all parts of the country, North and South, with entire confidence that all will be well with all of us.</quote><quote id="35" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">All this is not the result of accident. It has a philosophical cause. Without the "Constitution" and the "Union", we could not have attained the result; but even these, are not the primary cause of our great prosperity. There is something back of these, entwining itself more closely about the human heart. That something, is "the principle of "Liberty to all""--the principle that "clears the "path" for all--gives "hope" to all--and, by consequence, "enterprize", and "industry" to all." The "expression" of that principle, in our Declaration of Independence, was most happy, and fortunate. "Without" this, as well as "with" it, we could have declared our independence of Great Britain; but "without" it, we could not, I think, have secured our free government, and consequent prosperity. "No oppressed, people will "fight", and "endure"," as our fathers did, "without the promise of something better, than a mere change of masters." The assertion of that "principle", at that time, was the word, ""fitly spoken"" which has proved an "apple of gold" to us. The "Union", and the "Constitution", are the picture of silver, subsequently framed around it. The picture was made, not to "conceal", or "destroy" the apple; but to "adorn", and "preserve" it. The "picture" was made "for" the apple--"not" the apple for the picture. So let us act, that neither "picture", or "apple" shall ever be blurred, or bruised or broken. That we may so act, we must study, and understand the points of danger.</quote><quote id="36" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">While I do not expect, upon this occasion, or on any occasion, till after  I get to Washington, to attempt any lengthy speech, I will only say that to "the salvation of this Union" there "needs but one single thing---the hearts of a people like yours.

In all the trying positions in which I shall be placed, and doubtless I shall be placed in many trying ones, my reliance will be placed upon you and the people of the United States---and" I wish you to remember now and forever, that it is your business, and not mine; that if the union of these States, and the liberties of this people, shall be lost, it is but little to any one man of fifty-two years of age, but a great deal to the" thirty "millions of people who inhabit these United States, and to their posterity in all coming time. It is your business to rise up and preserve the Union and liberty, for yourselves, and not for me." I desire they shall be constitutionally preserved. I, as already intimated, am but an accidental instrument, temporary, and to serve but for a limited time, but I appeal to you again to constantly bear in mind that "with you, and not with politicians, not with Presidents, not with office-seekers, but with you, is the question, ``Shall the Union and shall the liberties of this country be preserved to the latest generation?`` "</quote><quote id="37" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that the "working men are the basis of all governments, for the plain reason that they are the most numerous", and as you added that those were the sentiments of the gentlemen present, representing not only the working class, but citizens of other callings than those of the mechanic, I am happy to concur with you in these sentiments, not only of the native born citizens, but also of the Germans and foreigners from other countries. Mr. Chairman, I hold that "while man exists, it is his duty to improve not only his own condition, but to assist in ameliorating mankind"; and therefore, without entering upon the details of the question, I will simply say, that I am for those means which will give the greatest good to the greatest number.</quote><quote id="38" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">I am rather inclined to silence, and whether that be wise or not, it is at least more unusual nowadays to find a man who can hold his tongue than to find one who cannot.</quote><quote id="39" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">They have seen in his round, jolly fruitful face, post-offices, land-offices, marshalships and cabinet-appointments, charge-ships and foreign missions, bursting out in wonderful exuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands.

"Is it unreasonable then to expect, that some man possessed of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch, will at some time, spring up among us?

By this influence, the jealousy, envy, and avarice incident to our nature and so common to a state of peace, prosperity, and conscious strength, were for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive, while the deep-rooted principles of hate, and the powerful motive of revenge, instead of being turned against each other, were directed exclusively against the British nation. And thus, "from the force of circumstances, the basest principles of our nature, were either made to lie dormant, or to become the active agents in the advancement of the noblest cause — that of establishing and maintaining civil and religious liberty. But this state of feeling "must fade, is fading, has faded", with the circumstances that produced it." I do not mean to say that the scenes of the Revolution are now or ever will be entirely forgotten, but that, like everything else, they must fade upon the memory of the world, and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time. In history, we hope, they will be read of, and recounted, so long as the Bible shall be read; but even granting that they will, their influence cannot be what it heretofore has been. Even then they cannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the generation just gone to rest. At the close of that struggle, nearly every adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes. The consequence was that of those scenes, in the form of a husband, a father, a son, or a brother, a living history was to be found in every family—a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own authenticity, in the limbs mangled, in the scars of wounds received, in the midst of the very scenes related—a history, too, that could be read and understood alike by all, the wise and the ignorant, the learned and the unlearned. But "those histories are gone. They can be read no more forever. They were a fortress of strength; but what invading foeman could never do, the silent artillery of time has done—the leveling of its walls. They are gone. They were a forest of giant oaks; but the all-restless hurricane has swept over them, and left only here and there a lonely trunk, despoiled of its verdure, shorn of its foliage, unshading and unshaded, to murmur in a few more gentle breezes, and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms, then to sink and be no more.

I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native land. But a moment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as I think there is) there may be in this in the long run, its sudden execution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their condition? I think I would not hold one in slavery at any rate, yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals. My own feelings will not admit of this, and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of whites will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question, if indeed it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot then make them equals.

At the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation, I meet that argument — I rush in — I take that bull by the horns. I trust I understand and truly estimate the right of self-government. My faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me. I extend the principle to communities of men as well as to individuals. I so extend it because it is politically wise, as well as naturally just: politically wise in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us. Here, or at Washington, I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia, or the cranberry laws of Indiana. The doctrine of self-government is right, — absolutely and eternally right, — but it has no just application as here attempted. Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has such application depends upon whether a negro is "not" or "is" a man. If he is "not" a man, in that case he who is a man may as a matter of self-government do just what he pleases with him.
But if the negro "is" a man, is it not to that extent a total destruction of self-government to say that he too shall not govern "himself". "When the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself and also governs "another" man, that is "more" than self-government — that is despotism. If the negro is a "man", why then my ancient faith teaches me that "all men are created equal," and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man's making a slave of another."</quote><quote id="92" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Judge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm, paraphrases our argument by saying: "The white people of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves, "but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes"!"
Well! I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the contrary. What I do say is that "no man is good enough to govern another man "without that other's consent."" I say "this is the leading principle, the sheet-anchor of American republicanism." Our Declaration of Independence says: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, "deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed"."
I have quoted so much at this time merely to show that, according to our ancient faith, "the just powers of governments are derived from the consent of the governed." Now the relation of master and slave is "pro tanto" a total violation of this principle. "The master not only governs the slave without his consent, but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different from those which he prescribes for himself. Allow ALL the governed an equal voice in the government, and that, and that only, is self-government."</quote><quote id="93" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref=""> "I insist, that if there is ANY THING which it is the duty of the WHOLE PEOPLE to never entrust to any hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity, of their own liberties, and institutions. </quote><quote id="94" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature — opposition to it, in his love of justice."

At the time I thought this was merely playful; and I answered it accordingly. But in his reply to me he renewed it, as a serious argument. In seriousness then, the facts of this proposition are not true as stated. God did not place good and evil before man, telling him to make his choice. On the contrary, he did tell him there was one tree, of the fruit of which, he should not eat, upon pain of certain death.</quote><quote id="100" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"We believe … in obedience to, and respect for the judicial department of government.

More than this would be revolution." But we think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous. … If this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of the judges, and without any apparent partisan bias, and in accordance with legal public expectation, and with the steady practice of the departments throughout our history, and had been in no part, based on assumed historical facts which are not really true; or, if wanting in some of these, it had been before the court more than once, and had there been affirmed and re-affirmed through a course of years, it then might be, perhaps would be, factious, nay, even revolutionary, to not acquiesce in it as a precedent.</quote><quote id="101" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Chief Justice does not directly assert, but plainly assumes, as a fact, that the public estimate of the black man is more favorable now than it was in the days of the Revolution. … "In those days, as I understand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate their slaves; but since then, such legal restraints have been made upon emancipation, as to amount almost to prohibition." In those days, Legislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective States; but now it is becoming quite fashionable for State Constitutions to withhold that power from the Legislatures. In those days, by common consent, the spread of the black man's bondage to new countries was prohibited; but now, Congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court decides that it could not if it would. "In those days, our Declaration of Independence was held sacred by all, and thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is assailed, and sneered at, and construed, and hawked at, and torn, till, if its framers could rise from their graves, they could not at all recognize it." All the powers of earth seem rapidly combining against him. Mammon is after him; ambition follows, and philosophy follows, and the Theology of the day is fast joining the cry. They have him in his prison house; they have searched his person, and left no prying instrument with him. "One after another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him, and now they have him, as it were, bolted in with a lock of a hundred keys, which can never be unlocked without the concurrence of every key; the keys in the hands of a hundred different men, and they scattered to a hundred different and distant places; and they stand musing as to what invention, in all the dominions of mind and matter, can be produced to make the impossibility of his escape more complete than it is. It is grossly incorrect to say or assume, that the public estimate of the negro is more favorable now than it was at the origin of the government."</quote><quote id="102" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">There is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people, to the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races; and Judge Douglas evidently is basing his chief hope, upon the chances of being able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to himself. If he can, by much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of that idea upon his adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through the storm. He therefore clings to this hope, as a drowning man to the last plank. He makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the Dred Scott decision. He finds the Republicans insisting that the Declaration of Independence includes ALL men, black as well as white; and forth-with he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all, and proceeds to argue gravely that all who contend it does, do so only because they want to vote, and eat, and sleep, and marry with negroes! He will have it that they cannot be consistent else. Now I protest against that counterfeit logic which concludes that, because I do not want "a black woman" for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife. I need not have her for either, I can just leave her alone.

This they said, and this meant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet, that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be familiar to all, and revered by all; constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere. The assertion that "all men are created equal"" was of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain; and it "was placed in the Declaration", nor for that, but "for future use. Its authors meant it to be", thank God, it is now proving itself, "a stumbling block to those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism. They knew the proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants, and they meant when such should re-appear in this fair land and commence their vocation they should find left for them at least one hard nut to crack."

Have we no tendency to the latter condition?
Let any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination — piece of machinery so to speak — compounded of the Nebraska doctrine, and the Dred Scott decision.</quote><quote id="109" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">The new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the States by State constitutions, and from most of the national territory by congressional prohibition. Four days later commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that congressional prohibition. This opened all the national territory to slavery, and was the first point gained. But, so far, Congress only had acted; and an indorsement by the people, real or apparent, was indispensable to save the point already gained and give chance for more. This necessity had not been overlooked; but had been provided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument of ""squatter sovereignty," otherwise called "sacred right of self government," which" latter "phrase", though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: "That if any one man, choose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed to object."</quote><quote id="110" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Under the Dred Scott decision, "squatter sovereignty" squatted out of existence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding — like the mould at the foundry served through one blast and fell back into loose sand — helped to carry an election, and then was kicked to the winds.</quote><quote id="111" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">The several points of the Dred Scott decision, in connection with Senator Douglas's "care-not" policy, constitute the piece of machinery, in its present state of advancement. This was the third point gained. The working points of that machinery are: (1) That no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no descendant of such slave, can ever be a citizen of any State, in the sense of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States. This point is made in order to deprive the negro in every possible event of the benefit of that provision of the United States Constitution which declares that "the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States." (2) That, "subject to the Constitution of the United States," neither Congress nor a territorial legislature can exclude slavery from any United States Territory. This point is made in order that individual men may fill up the Territories with slaves, without danger of losing them as property, and thus enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future. (3) That whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free State makes him free as against the holder, the United States courts will not decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave State the negro may be forced into by the master. This point is made not to be pressed immediately, but, if acquiesced in for a while, and apparently indorsed by the people at an election, then to sustain the logical conclusion that what Dred Scott's master might lawfully do with Dred Scott in the free State of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do with any other one or one thousand slaves in Illinois or in any other free State.</quote><quote id="112" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Auxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it, the Nebraska doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mold public opinion, at least Northern public opinion, not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up. This shows exactly where we now are; and partially, also, whither we are tending.
It will throw additional light on the latter, to go back, and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated. Several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring. The people were to be left "perfectly free," subject only to the Constitution. What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders could not then see. Plainly enough now, it was an exactly fitted niche, for the Dred Scott decision to afterward come in, and declare the perfect free freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all. Why was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people, voted down? Plainly enough now: the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.</quote><quote id="113" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">We cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert.

To meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty is the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation. This is what we have to do. How can we best do it ?</quote><quote id="116" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">There are those who denounce us openly to their own friends and yet whisper us softly, that Senator Douglas is the aptest instrument there is with which to effect that object. They wish us to infer all this from the fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty; and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point upon which he and we have never differed. "They remind us that he is a great man, and that the largest of us are very small ones. Let this be granted. But "a living dog is better than a dead lion." Judge Douglas, if not a dead lion, for this work, is at least a caged and toothless one." How can he oppose the advances of slavery? He does not care anything about it. His avowed mission is impressing the "public heart" to care nothing about it. A leading Douglas Democratic newspaper thinks Douglas's superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the African slave-trade. Does Douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching? He has not said so. Does he really think so? But if it is, how can he resist it? For years he has labored to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves into the new Territories. Can he possibly show that it is less a sacred right to buy them where they can be bought cheapest? And unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in Africa than in Virginia. He has done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property; and as such, how can he oppose the foreign slave trade — how can he refuse that trade in that "property" shall be "perfectly free" — unless he does it as a protection to the home production? And as the home producers will probably not ask the protection, he will be wholly without a ground of opposition.</quote><quote id="117" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Senator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may rightfully be wiser today than he was yesterday — that he may rightfully change when he finds himself wrong.

"Whenever, if ever, he and we can come together on principle so that our cause may have assistance from his great ability, I hope to have interposed no adventitious obstacle. But clearly, he is not now with us — he does not pretend to be — he does not promise ever to be.

Wise counsels may accelerate, or mistakes delay it, but, sooner or later, the victory is sure to come."</quote><quote id="120" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Now, it happens that we meet together once every year, sometimes about the fourth of July, for some reason or other. These fourth of July gatherings I suppose have their uses. … We are now a mighty nation; we are thirty, or about thirty, millions of people, and we own and inhabit about one-fifteenth part of the dry land of the whole earth. We run our memory back over the pages of history for about eighty-two years, and we discover that we were then a very small people in point of numbers, vastly inferior to what we are now, with a vastly less extent of country, with vastly less of everything we deem desirable among men; we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our posterity, and we fix upon something that happened away back, as in some way or other being connected with this rise of prosperity. "We find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers; they were iron men; they fought for the principle that they were contending for; and we understood that by what they then did it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we now enjoy has come to us." We hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of time, of how it was done and who did it, and how we are historically connected with it; and we go from these meetings in better humor with ourselves, we feel more attached the one to the other, and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit. In every way we are better men in the age, and race, and country in which we live, for these celebrations. But after we have done all this we have not yet reached the whole. There is something else connected with it. We have besides these, men descended by blood from our ancestors — among us, perhaps half our people, who are not descendants at all of these men; they are men who have come from Europe — German, Irish, French and Scandinavian — men that have come from Europe themselves, or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here, finding themselves our equals in all things. If they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none, they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us, but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence, they find that those old men say that "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal" and then they feel that that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration; and so they are. "That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world."</quote><quote id="121" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Those arguments that are made, "that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying"; that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allow. What are these arguments? They are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world. "You will find that all the arguments in favor of king-craft were of this class; they always bestrode the necks of the people, not that they wanted to do it, but because the people were better off for being ridden. That is their argument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old serpent that says you work and I eat, you toil and I will enjoy the fruits of it." Turn in whatever way you will, whether it come from the mouth of a King, an excuse for enslaving the people of this country, or from the mouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race, it is all the same old serpent, and I hold if that course of argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind that we should not care about this, should be granted, it does not stop with the negro. I should like to know if, taking this old Declaration of Independence, which declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making exceptions to it, where will it stop? If one man says it does not mean a negro, why not another say it does not mean some other man? If that declaration is not the truth, let us get the Statute book, in which we find it, and tear it out! Who is so bold as to do it? If it is not true let us tear it out! [Cries of "No, No."] Let us stick to it, then; let us stand firmly by it, then. It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man, he must submit to it. I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this Government. We had slavery among us, we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery, we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more; and having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties. Let that charter stand as our standard.</quote><quote id="122" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">My friend has said to me that I am a poor hand to quote Scripture. I will try it again, however. It is said in one of the admonitions of our Lord, "As your Father in Heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect." The Saviour, I suppose, did not expect that any human creature could be perfect as the Father in Heaven; but He said, "As your Father in Heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect." He set that up as a standard; and he who did most toward reaching that standard, attained the highest degree of moral perfection. So I say in relation to the principle that all men are created equal, let it be as nearly reached as we can. "If we cannot give freedom to every creature, let us do nothing that will impose slavery upon any other creature." Let us then turn this Government back into the channel in which the framers of the Constitution originally placed it. Let us stand firmly by each other. If we do not do so we are turning in the contrary direction, that our friend Judge Douglas proposes — not intentionally — as working in the traces tend to make this one universal slave nation. He is one that runs in that direction, and as such I resist him. My friends, I have detained you about as long as I desired to do, and I have only to say, "let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man; this race and that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position; discarding our standard that we have left us. Let us discard all these things, and unite as one people throughout this land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal." My friends, I could not, without launching off upon some new topic, which would detain you too long, continue to-night. I thank you for this most extensive audience that you have furnished me to-night. "I leave you, hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal."</quote><quote id="123" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists.

While I had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject, yet as the question was asked me, I thought I would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard to it. "I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races", that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that "there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality". And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and "I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race". I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything. I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife. My understanding is that I can just let her alone. I am now in my fiftieth year, and I certainly never had a black woman for either a slave or a wife. So it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes. I will add to this that I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman, or child who was in favor of producing a perfect equality, social and political, between negroes and white men.</quote><quote id="126" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">I have never had the least apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes if there was no law to keep them from it, but as Judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the law of this State, which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes.</quote><quote id="127" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death? </quote><quote id="128" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Now, I have upon all occasions declared as strongly as Judge Douglas against the disposition to interfere with the existing institution of slavery.

Allow me while upon this subject briefly to present one other extract from a speech of mine, more than a year ago, at Springfield, in discussing this very same question, soon after Judge Douglas took his ground that negroes were not included in the Declaration of Independence: "I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men, but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all men were equal in color, size, intellect, moral development, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equal — equal in "certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This they said, and this they meant." They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality, or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. "They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all, constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere."</quote><quote id="129" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">That is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. "It is the eternal struggle between these two principles — right and wrong — throughout the world." They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time; and will ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity, and the other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that says, "You toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it."

Long after civilized nations had defined robbery and murder as high crimes, and had affixed severe punishments to them, when practiced among and upon their own people respectively, it was deemed no offence, but even meritorious, to rob, and murder, and enslave strangers, whether as nations or as individuals. Even yet, this has not totally disappeared. The man of the highest moral cultivation, in spite of all which abstract principle can do, likes him whom he does know, much better than him whom he does not know. To correct the evils, great and small, which spring from want of sympathy, and from positive enmity, among strangers, as nations, or as individuals, is one of the highest functions of civilization.</quote><quote id="131" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Every man is proud of what he does "well"; and no man is proud of what he does "not" do well.

I scarcely ever knew a mammoth farm to sustain itself; much less to return a profit upon the outlay. I have more than once known a man to spend a respectable fortune upon one; fail and leave it; and then some man of more modest aims, get a small fraction of the ground, and make a good living upon it. Mammoth farms are like tools or weapons, which are too heavy to be handled. Ere long they are thrown aside, at a great loss.</quote><quote id="133" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">The world is agreed that labor is the source from which human wants are mainly supplied. There is no dispute upon this point. From this point, however, men immediately diverge. Much disputation is maintained as to the best way of applying and controlling the labor element. By some it is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital -- that nobody labors, unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow, by the use of that capital, induces him to do it. Having assumed this, they proceed to consider whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent; or buy them, and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so far they naturally conclude that all laborers are necessarily either hired laborers, or slaves. They further assume that whoever is once a hired laborer, is fatally fixed in that condition for life; and thence again that his condition is as bad as, or worse than that of a slave. This is the "mud-sill" theory. ... By the "mud-sill" theory it is assumed that labor and education are incompatible; and any practical combination of them impossible. According to that theory, a blind horse upon a tread-mill, is a perfect illustration of what a laborer should be -- all the better for being blind, that he could not tread out of place, or kick understandingly. According to that theory, the education of laborers, is not only useless, but pernicious, and dangerous. In fact, it is, in some sort, deemed a misfortune that laborers should have heads at all.</quote><quote id="134" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">The old general rule was that "educated" people did not perform manual labor. They managed to eat their bread, leaving the toil of producing it to the uneducated. This was not an insupportable evil to the working bees, so long as the class of drones remained very small. But "now", especially in these free States, nearly all are educated -- quite too nearly all, to leave the labor of the uneducated, in any wise adequate to the support of the whole. It follows from this that henceforth educated people must labor. Otherwise, education itself would become a positive and intolerable evil. "No country can sustain, in idleness, more than a small per centage of its numbers. The great majority must labor at something productive."</quote><quote id="135" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">I suppose, however, I shall not be mistaken, in assuming as a fact, that the people of Wisconsin prefer free labor, with its natural companion, education. This leads to the further reflection, that no other human occupation opens so wide a field for the profitable and agreeable combination of labor with cultivated thought, as agriculture. "I know of nothing so pleasant to the mind, as the discovery of anything which is at once "new" and "valuable" -- nothing which so lightens and sweetens toil, as the hopeful pursuit of such discovery." And how vast, and how varied a field is agriculture, for such discovery. The mind, already trained to thought, in the country school, or higher school, cannot fail to find there an exhaustless source of profitable enjoyment.</quote><quote id="136" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Every blade of grass is a study; and to produce two, where there was but one, is both a profit and a pleasure."</quote><quote id="137" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"A capacity, and taste, for reading, gives access to whatever has already been discovered by others.

And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time, "the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal."

The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This I think, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. "Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them.

Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the general tone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers except the legislative boldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people.

And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages. And I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.

To such I would say: You desire peace; and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we attain it? There are but three conceivable ways. First, to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This, I am trying to do. Are you for it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a second way is, to give up the Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If you are, you should say so plainly. If you are not for "force", nor yet for "dissolution", there only remains some imaginable "compromise". I do not believe any compromise, embracing the maintenance of the Union, is now possible. All I learn, leads to a directly opposite belief. The strength of the rebellion, is its military---its army. That army dominates all the country, and all the people, within its range. Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men, have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them.</quote><quote id="208" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">A compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control the rebel army, or with the people first liberated from the domination of that army, by the success of our own army. Now allow me to assure you, that no word or intimation, from that rebel army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief. All charges and insinuations to the contrary, are deceptive and groundless. And I promise you, that if any such proposition shall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected, and kept a secret from you.

The most that can be said, if so much, is, that slaves are property. Is there---has there ever been---any question that by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed? And is it not needed whenever taking it, helps us, or hurts the enemy?" Armies, the world over, destroy enemies' property when they can not use it; and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy. Civilized belligerents do all  in their power to help themselves, or hurt the enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel. Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes, and non-combatants, male and female.</quote><quote id="211" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"But the proclamation, as law, either is valid, or is not valid. If it is not valid, it needs no retraction. If it is valid, it can not be retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life." Some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for the Union. Why better after the retraction, than before the issue? There was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation issued, the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming, unless averted by those in revolt, returning to their allegiance. The war has certainly progressed as favorably for us, since the issue of the proclamation as before. I  know as fully as one can know the opinions of others, that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important successes, believe the emancipation policy, and the use of colored troops, constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion; and that, at least one of those important successes, could not have been achieved when it was, but for the aid of black soldiers. Among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism, or with republican party politics; but who hold them purely as military opinions. I submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections, often urged, that emancipation, and arming the blacks, are unwise as military measures, and were not adopted, as such, in good faith.</quote><quote id="212" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">You say you will not fight to free negroes.

But "negroes, like other people, act  upon motives. Why should they do any thing for us, if we will do nothing for them?

And then, "there will be some black men who can remember that, with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great consummation; while, I fear, there will be some white ones, unable to forget that, with malignant heart, and deceitful speech, they have strove to hinder it."</quote><quote id="215" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Still let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy final triumph.

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. "But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow, this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced." It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that "we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."</quote><quote id="217" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"I am naturally anti-slavery.

Nor was it my view that I might take an oath to get power, and break the oath in using the power. I understood, too, that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery. I had publicly declared this many times, and in many ways. And I aver that, to this day, I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery." I did understand however, that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, that government — that nation — of which that constitution was the organic law.</quote><quote id="218" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Was it possible to lose the nation, and yet preserve the constitution?

Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it.

Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come. When, in March, and May, and July 1862 I made earnest, and successive appeals to the border states to favor compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation, and arming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure. They declined the proposition; and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it, the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose the latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss; but of this, I was not entirely confident. More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white military force, — no loss by it any how or any where. On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite a hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers. These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no cavilling.

There is involved in this struggle the question whether your children and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed."</quote><quote id="224" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">I say this in order to impress upon you, if you are not already so impressed, that "no small matter should divert us from our great purpose." There may be some irregularities in the practical application of our system. "It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value of his property; but if we should wait before collecting a tax to adjust the taxes upon each man in exact proportion with every other man, we should never collect any tax at all." There may be mistakes made sometimes; things may be done wrong while the officers of the Government do all they can to prevent mistakes. But I beg of you, as citizens of this great Republic, not to let your minds to carried off from the great work we have before us. "This struggle is too large for you to be diverted from it by any small matter."</quote><quote id="225" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">When you return to your homes rise up to the height of a generation of men worthy of a free Government, and we will carry out the great work we have commenced. I return to you my sincere thanks, soldiers, for the honor you have done me this afternoon.</quote><quote id="226" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">I suppose you are going home to see your families and friends.

"It is not merely for to-day, but for all time to come that we should perpetuate for our children's children this great and free government, which we have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you to remember this, not merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen temporarily to occupy this big White House. I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has."</quote><quote id="228" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"It is in order that each of you may have through this free government" which we have enjoyed, "an open field and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise and intelligence; that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life, with all its desirable human aspirations. It is for this the struggle should be maintained", that we may not lose our birthright--not only for one, but for two or three years. "The nation is worth fighting for, to secure such an inestimable jewel."</quote><quote id="229" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">SOLDIERS OF THE 148TH OHIO:---I am most happy to meet you on this occasion. I understand that it has been your honorable privilege to stand, for a brief period, in the defense of your country, and that now you are on your way to your homes. I congratulate you, and those who are waiting to bid you welcome home from the war; and permit me, in the name of the people, to thank you for the part you have taken in this struggle for the life of the nation. You are soldiers of the Republic, everywhere honored and respected. "Whenever I appear before a body of soldiers, I feel tempted to talk to them of the nature of the struggle in which we are engaged. I look upon it as an attempt on the one hand to overwhelm and destroy the national existence, while, on our part, we are striving to maintain the government and institutions of our fathers, to enjoy them ourselves, and transmit them to our children and our children's children forever."</quote><quote id="230" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">To do this the constitutional administration of our government must be sustained, and I beg of you not to allow your minds or your hearts to be diverted from the support of all necessary measures for that purpose, by any miserable picayune arguments addressed to your pockets, or inflammatory appeals made to your passions or your prejudices.</quote><quote id="231" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">It is vain and foolish to arraign this man or that for the part he has taken, or has not taken, and to hold the government responsible for his acts. "In no administration can there be perfect equality of action and uniform satisfaction rendered by all. But this government must be preserved in spite of the acts of any man or set of men." It is worthy your every effort. "Nowhere in the world is presented a government of so much liberty and equality. To the humblest and poorest amongst us are held out the highest privileges and positions. The present moment finds me at the White House, yet there is as good a chance for your children as there was for my father's."</quote><quote id="232" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">Again I admonish you not to be turned from your stern purpose of defending your beloved country and its free institutions by any arguments urged by ambitious and designing men, but stand fast to the Union and the old flag. Soldiers, I bid you God-speed to your homes.</quote><quote id="233" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"It has long been a grave question whether any government, not too strong for the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies." On this point the present rebellion brought our government to a severe test, and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little to the strain.</quote><quote id="234" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves? But the election was a necessity. We cannot have free government without elections"; and if the election could force us to forego or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us. "The strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts of the case. What has occurred in this case must ever recur in similar cases. Human nature will not change. In any future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we will have as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as good. Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged."</quote><quote id="235" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">" But the election, along with its incidental and undesirable strife, has done good, too. It has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain a national election in the midst of a great civil war. Until now, it has not been known to the world that this was a possibility." It shows, also, how sound and strong we still are. It shows that even among the candidates of the same party, he who is most devoted to the Union and most opposed to treason can receive most of the people's votes. It shows, also, to the extent yet known, that we have more men now than we had when the war began. "Gold is good in its place; but living, brave, and patriotic men are better than gold."</quote><quote id="236" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"But the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is over, may not all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our common country?" For my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am duly sensible to the high compliment of a re-election, and duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God, for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think, for their good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed by the result.</quote><quote id="237" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"May I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have?" And now, let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen, and their gallant and skillful commanders.</quote><quote id="238" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would "make" war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would "accept" war rather than let it perish. And the war came..." Neither party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the "cause" of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease. "Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered; that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has his own purposes."</quote><quote id="239" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a Living God always ascribe to Him? "Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, "The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."".</quote><quote id="240" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">"With malice toward none, with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan — to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations."</quote><quote id="241" author="Abraham Lincoln" cats="1860s deaths|Illinoisans|Kentuckians|Lawyers|United States Presidents" ref="">The Lord prefers common-looking people.
